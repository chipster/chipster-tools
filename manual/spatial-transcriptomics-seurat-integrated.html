	<h2>Seurat v4 -Integration with scRNA-seq data</h2>

	<h3>Description</h3>

	<p>
		This tool integrates the spatial data with scRNA-seq data to predict the proportion of different celltypes in the Visium spots.
	</p>

	<h3>Details</h3>

	<p>
		This tool enables the prediction of the underlying composition of cell types present in each of the spatial voxels in the Visium spots. 
		It applies the 'anchor'-based integration to enable the probabilistic transfer of annotations from the scRNA-seq reference to the query set.
	</p>

	<p>
		As an input, give the Seurat object and the reference scRNA-seq dataset. 
		The reference set should contain all the celltypes you expect to find in your spots, ideally from the exact same tissue.
	</p>

	<p>
		For more details, please check the <a href="https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/spatial_vignette.html">Seurat tutorials
			for integration with single-cell data</a>.

		<li>seurat_obj_integrated.Robj: The Seurat R-object to pass to the next Seurat tool, or to import to R. Not viewable in
			Chipster. </li>
		<li>reference_UMAP_plot.pdf: UMAP plot showing the reference data and the annotations. </li>
