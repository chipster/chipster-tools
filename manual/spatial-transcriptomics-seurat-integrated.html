	<h2>Seurat v4 -Integration with scRNA-seq data</h2>

	<h3>Description</h3>

	<p>
		This tool integrates the spatial data with scRNA-seq data to predict the proportion of different cell types in
		the Visium spots.
	</p>

	<h3>Parameters</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Number of subsampling cells in SCTransform when normalizing reference dataset [5000]</li>
    </ul>

	<h3>Details</h3>

	<p>
		This tool enables the prediction of the underlying composition of cell types present in each of the Visium spot
		spatial voxels.
		It applies 'anchor'-based integration to enable the probabilistic transfer of annotations from the scRNA-seq
		reference to the query set.
	</p>

	<p>
		Please provide both the Seurat object and the reference scRNA-seq dataset as inputs.
		The reference dataset should contain all the expected cell types, ideally from the exact same tissue.
		The reference dataset should be a Seurat object stored as .rds file.
		Moreover, the cell type annotations should be found in the "subclass" column in the metadata slot of the
		reference object (seurat_obj@meta.data$subclass),
		and the gene IDs used should be the same as in the actual data (gene symbols, Ensembl IDs etc).
	</p>
	</p>
	You can also use the tool "Extract information from Seurat object" to check whether your reference data is in the
	right format.
	</p>

			tutorials

	<h3>Output</h3>

	<ul>

		<li>seurat_obj_integrated.Robj: This is the Seurat R-object to pass to the next Seurat tool, or to import into
			R. However, this is not viewable in
			Chipster. </li>
		<li>reference_UMAP_plot.pdf: This is the UMAP plot showing the reference data and annotations. </li>
	</ul>
