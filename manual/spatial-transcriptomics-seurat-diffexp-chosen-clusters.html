    <h2>Seurat v4 -Identify spatially variable genes based on clusters</h2>

    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
        Find differentially expressed genes between two clusters that meet FindMarkers criteria.
    </p>

    <h3>Parameters</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Cluster to identify markers [1]</li>
        <li>Cluster for comparison [2]</li>
        <li>Test used for differential expression [wilcox]
    </ul>


    <h3>Details</h3>

    <p>
        As an input, you can provide the Seurat object generated using the tool: Seurat v4- PCA, clustering and visualisation. <br>
    </p>

    <p>
        Select the clusters in which you would like to identify spatially variable genes. As an example, differential expression is performed between clusters 1 and 2.
        The first cluster is used as the identity class to define markers and the second cluster is used as the identity class for comparison.
    </p>
    <p>
        Select the test used for differential expression. Options for this are the Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test (wilcox) or the hurdle model tailored to scRNA-seq analysis called MAST. Wilcox is set as the default.
