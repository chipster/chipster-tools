    <h2>Seurat v4 -Identify differentially expressed features based on clusters</h2>

    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
        Find differentially expressed genes between  pre-annotated anatomical regions within the tissue.
    </p>

    <h3>Parameters</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Cluster to identify markers for [1]</li>
        <li>Cluster for comparison [2]</li>
        <li>Test used in the differential expression [wilcox]
    </ul>


    <h3>Details</h3>

    <p>
        As inputs, you can give the Seurat object from the Seurat v4- PCA, clustering and visualisation. <br>
    </p>

    <p>
        Select the clusters you want to find spatially variable genes. As an example, the differential expression is performed between cluster 1 and 2.
        The first clusters is used as the identity class to define markers for and the other as the identity class for comparison.
    </p>
    <p>
        Select the test used for the differential expression. Options for this are the Wilcoxon Rank sum test and the hurdle model tailored to scRNA-seq analysis called MAST. By default wilcox is used.
    </p>
