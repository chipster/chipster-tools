<h2>Remove samples from a Phyloseq object</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
This tool can be used to remove up to five user-specified samples from a <a href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/phyloseq.html">phyloseq</a> object. Produces a phyloseq object without the defined samples and saves it as an Rda file, and a summary of the subsetted phyloseq object.
</p>


<h3>Parameters</h3>
<ul>
<li>Samples to be removed (up to five)
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>
<p>Names of samples to be removed (one to five) are typed into the provided text fields. The sample names should be written exactly as they appear in the phenodata table. 
    If any of the entered sample names do not match those in the phenodata table, a warning is shown. 
<br>
<br>
After removing samples, it is recommended to run the tool Remove OTUs with 0-20 ocurrences with the filtering threshold
of 0. This step removes OTUs that occur only in the samples that were removed and have 0 occurrences in the current set of samples. 
</p>
<p> 
The tool requires the following input files:
<ul>
<li>A <a href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/phyloseq.html">phyloseq</a> object in Rda format</li>
</ul>
The tool employs the following R functions and packages:
<ul>
<li>subset_samples() (<a href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/phyloseq.html">phyloseq</a>)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
The tool produces the following output files:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/phyloseq.html">Phyloseq</a> object following removal of specified samples (ps_subset.Rda)</li>
<li>Text summary of the phyloseq object following sample removal (ps_subset.txt)</li>
</ul>
