	<h2>Seurat -Visualize genes with cell type-specific responses in multiple samples</h2>

	<h3>Description</h3>

	<p>
		This tool generates plots based on your selection of markers or genes across conditions.
		This tool can be used on Seurat objects containing two or more samples.
	</p>

	<h3>Parameters</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Markers to plot [CD3D, CREM, HSPH1, SELL, GIMAP5]</li>
	</ul>


	<h3>Details</h3>

	<p>
		Please input a combined Seurat object. <br>
	</p>

	<p>
		Select the markers you would like to inspect by listing them in the parameter row. The markers can also be input
		in a text file format.
		Separate the names with comma(s) (,). As an example, the parameter is set to markers "CD3D, CREM, HSPH1, SELL,
		GIMAP5".
	</p>

	<p>
		The "SplitDotPlotGG" can be useful for visualizing conserved cell type markers across conditions,
		showing both the expression level and percentage of cells in a cluster expressing any given gene.
		The <b>size of the dot</b> encodes the percentage of cells within a class (=cluster),
		while the <b>color</b> encodes the AverageExpression level of 'expressing' cells (stronger color, more
		expression).
	</p>

	<p>
		Another useful way to visualize the changes in gene expression is using the FeatureHeatmap function.
		This will display FeaturePlots of the gene list, split according to condition.
	</p>

	<p>
		In case of more than two samples, the plots are divided into multiple pages.
	</p>
