	<h2>Chipster training courses</h2>


	<p>We run several bioinformatics courses on different topics every year in Finland and abroad. The courses at CSC
		are open for everybody,
		but you can also contact us to discuss options for hosting a course on your site.</p>

	<p>We make our course materials publicly available so that anyone can download them for their own use.
		The materials include slides and exercises, and many courses have also lecture videos.
		The exercise data are available as example sessions on the Chipster server, and
		we also provide ready-made analysis sessions which you can use as a reference when doing exercises on your own.
	</p>

	<p>
		We also provide <b>training accounts</b> to our Chipster server in Finland.
		Note, that users from Finnish universities and research institutes can use their HAKA and VIRTU logins to access
		Chipster, so no training account is needed.
		However, <b>we kindly ask you to inform us about upcoming Chipster courses</b>
		(number of participants, type of analysis jobs) so that we can add computing resources to the server if needed.
	</p>
	</p>

	<p>We run currently the following Chipster courses (follow the links for more info). CSC runs also <a
			href="https://research.csc.fi/bioscience-learning-materials">other bioinformatics courses</a>,
		you can find the upcoming courses in our <a href="https://www.csc.fi/en/training">course
			calendar</a>.</p>

	<h3><a name="quantseq">3' RNA-seq data analysis (QuantSeq)</a></h3>

	This course module covers the preprocessing steps specific for QuantSeq FWD UMI 3’ mRNA-seq data. For the rest of the analysis, 
	the typical RNA-seq data analysis steps described above in the RNA-seq course material can be used.
	
	QuantSeq reads contain 6 nt unique molecular identifiers (UMIs), which help to reduce amplification bias. This is particularly useful for low-input 
	and FFPE samples. In data analysis the UMIs need to be removed and stored in the read name before alignment to genome. Reads which map to the same 
	genomic location and have the same UMI are grouped together, and only one representative read is kept. In addition to dealing with UMIs, 
	polyA read-through to adapters needs to be trimmed.
	
	The course takes half a day. You will learn how to
	<ul>
		<li>extract UMIs from reads using the extract tool of the UMI-Tools package</li>
		<li>trim reads using the BBDuk tool of the BBTools package</li>
		<li>check the quality of reads after preprocessing with MultiQC</li>
		<li>align reads to the reference genome with HISAT2 and STAR</li>
		<li>deduplicate the aligned QuantSeq reads using the dedup tool of the UMI-Tools package</li>
