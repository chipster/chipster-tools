<h2>Extract .tar or .tar.gz file</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
Extract a tar file. The file can be gzip compressed (usually has a file extension .tar.gz or .tgz). 
  Please note that if the tar file is bigger than 100 GB, you should use instead the tool Extract large .tar or .tar.gz file.
</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Extract by filename (STRING)[]</li>
<li>Extract by extension (STRING)[]</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>
<p>
All files are extracted by default, but you can choose to extract only one or some of the files by giving the 
names of the files to be extracted as a parameter "Extract by filename" or filename extension as parameter "Extract 
by extension". If more than one name or extension is specified, separate them with a comma (e.g. abc123_1.fq,abc123_2.fq
or .html,.log).
</p>
<p>
Alternatively you can provide a list of filenames as a text file, one name per line. 
</p>
<p>
To see the contents of a .tar file, you can use use tool "Utilities / List contents of a tar file". This 
  produces a text file. if you want to use this file as base for making a filename list, you can edit it outside of Chipster and import the edited one.

arhives compressed with bz2. See the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/tarfile.html">Python tarfile</a> 
documentation for the details about support for other formats.
