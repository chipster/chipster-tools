<h2>Seurat -Visualize genes </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
With this tool, you can visualize selected genes using violin, UMAP, or ridge plots. You can input the Seurat R-object
(.Robj) and gene of interest name(s) (e.g., MS4A1, LYZ, PF4...). The gene name(s) can also be provided in a text file in the input field.
<br>Please note: If you list multiple gene names, use commas (,) as separators.
</p>
 
 <h3>Parameters</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Gene name</li>
	<li>Point size in cluster plot [1]</li>
	<li>Add labels on top of clusters in plot (yes, no) [no]</li>
	<li>Visualisation with t-SNE, UMAP or PCA [UMAP]</li>
	<li>Plotting order of cells based on expression (yes, no) [no]</li>
	<li>Provide a list of average expression and percentage of cells expressing the selected gene in each cluster (yes, no) [no]</li>
</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>
 
<p>
Both the <b>Violin plot</b> and <b>ridge plot</b> show the probability density at different expression levels of the gene for each cluster. 
The color coding of the clusters helps with visualizing the expression of marker gene(s).
You can look for marker genes specific to each cluster.
</p>
<p>
<b>The UMAP plot</b> is useful for visualizing the expression of the selected marker gene in the context of all the cells. It also helps validate the specificity of the marker or 
the quality of the clustering. It can be useful to plot cells in order of expression, particularly if cells expressing a given gene are are difficult to detect.
</p>
<p>
You can generate two tables, one which shows the average expression for each gene and one that shows the percentage of cells expressing the gene(s) in each cluster.
