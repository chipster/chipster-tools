    <h2>Seurat -SCTransform: Normalize, regress and detect variable genes </h2>

    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
        This tool uses the SCTransform method for normalization, scaling and finding variable genes.
        You can also choose to regress out differences caused by the cell cycle stage.
        <br>
        <b>Note</b>, that this tool and <a
            href="https://chipster.rahtiapp.fi/manual/single-cell-seurat-filter-regress-v3.html">Seurat - Normalize,
            regress and detect variable genes</a>
        tool are doing the same thing using different methods: you can choose between the two.
    </p>

    <h3>Parameters</h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>Number of variable genes to return [3000] </li>
        <li>Regress out cell cycle differences [no] </li>
    </ul>
    </p>


    <h3>Details</h3>

    <p>
        The tool performs the following three steps included in the SCTransform tool:
        normalization, scaling and finding variable
        genes.
    </p>
    <p>
        As an input, give the filtered Seurat R-object (Robj) from the Seurat
        Filter cells tool. The R-object output can be used as an input for the Seurat -PCA tool.
    </p>
    <p>
        Compared to the basic Seurat normalization + scaling + variable gene finding,
        the SCTransform workflow performs more effective normalization,
        strongly removing technical effects from the data.
        This allows more PCs to be selected in the PCA step, as the higher PCs are more likely to represent
        subtle, but biologically relevant, sources of heterogeneity instead of variation in sequencing depth.
    </p>


    <ol>
        <li><b>Expression values are normalized</b> using the SCTransform normalisation method, which uses
            Pearson residuals from regularized negative binomial regression,
            where cellular sequencing depth is utilized as a covariate in a generalized linear model (GLM).
            The parameters for the model are estimated by pooling information across genes that are expressed at
            similar levels.
            This should remove the technical variation but preserve the biological heterogeneity,
            and avoid over-fitting the model to the data.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Genes which are highly variable across the cells are detected</b> using the Pearson residuals
            computed in the normalization step. The highly variable genes will be used in downstream analysis, like PCA.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Uninteresting sources of variation in the expression values are regressed out</b> during normalization in
            order to improve
            dimensionality reduction and clustering later on.
            This tool regresses on
            <!--<i>the number of detected molecules per cell</i> as well as--> the <i>percentage
                mitochondrial transcript content</i>.

            <br>You can also choose to regress out <i>cell cycle differences</i>.
            By choosing <i> all differences</i> the tool removes all signal associated with cell cycle.
            In some cases this method can negatively impact downstream analysis,
            particularly in differentiating processes, where stem cells are quiescent and differentiated cells are
            proliferating (or vice versa).
            Alternatively you can <i>regress out the difference between the G2M and S phase scores</i>.
            This means that signals separating non-cycling cells and cycling cells will be maintained, but differences
            in cell cycle phase amongst proliferating cells (which are often uninteresting), will be regressed out of
            the data. For more information, check out the <a
