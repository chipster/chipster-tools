	<h2>Seurat v5 -Identify spatially variable genes without pre-annotation</h2>

	<h3>Description</h3>

	<p>
		This tool searches for genes that exhibit spatial patterning. It does not use any pre-annotation (cluster) information. If you would like to use cluster information, you may use this tool <i> Seurat v5 -Identify spatially variable genes based on clusters</i>. 
    </p>

	<p>
		If you performed multiple sample analysis i.e. if your samples have been merged or integrated into one single seurat object, select 'yes' as the value for parameter 'Multiple sample analysis'.
		However, this tool will still identify spatially variable genes for each sample individually.
	</p>

	<h3>Parameters</h3>
	<ul>
			<li>Methods to use [moransi]</li>
			<li>Number of features to plot[6]</li>
			<li>Multiple sample analysis [no]</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Details</h3>

	<p>
        This tool identifies and selects features exhibiting spatial patterning by using the moransi or markvariogram method. 
		Markvariogram models spatial transcriptomics data as a mark point process and computes a 'variogram', which identifies genes whose expression level is dependent on their spatial location. 
		Specifically, this process calculates gamma(r) values measuring the dependence between two spots that are a certain “r” distance apart. These values are only computed for variable genes (where variation is calculated independently of spatial location).
		The expression levels of the top features are displayed in the SpatialFeaturePlot.

	<p>
		As input, you can provide the Seurat object after clustering. </i>
