    <h2>Seurat -Extract cells in a cluster </h2>

    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
        This tool gives you a subset of the data: only those cells of a user defined cluster.

    </p>

    <h3>Parameters</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Name of the cluster [3]</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Details</h3>

    <p>
        As inputs, give the Seurat object created AFTER clustering step: either after
    <ul>
        <li><b>Seurat v5 -Clustering</b> tool,</li>
        <li>or after <b>Seurat v5 -Integrate multiple samples</b> tool in case of multiple sample analysis. </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        Select the cluster you want to inspect by setting its name in the parameter field.
        As an example, the parameter is set to cluster "3".
    </p>

    <p>
        You can continue analysing this subsetted R-object by running the Seurat tools again;
        in the case you started with a single sample
        (subsetting after <b>Seurat v5 -Clustering</b> tool),
        you can start with the filtering and finding variable genes, and continue from there.
        <br>
        If you started with a combined Seurat object of two samples
        (subsetting after <b>Seurat v5 -Integrated analysis of two samples</b> tool),
        you can continue by running the after <b>Seurat v5 -Integrate multiple samples</b> tool again.
    </p>

    <p>
        Note that the cell filtering (number of genes per cell, mito%) done in the original dataset
        effect this object as well.
    </p>


    <h3>Output</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>seurat_obj_subset.Robj: The Seurat R-object containing only the cells in the chosen clustesr. Can be passed
            to the next Seurat tool, or imported to R. You cannot open this file in Chipster,
			but you can view the contents of the object using the <i>Extract information from Seurat object</i> tool. </li>
        <li>QCplots.pdf: Quality control plots (similar to the ones in Setup tool.)</li>
    </ul>
