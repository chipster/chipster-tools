<h2>Merge two ASV tables</h2>

  <h3>Description</h3>
  
  <p>
    This tool merges two ASV/sequence tables, for example from two different sequencing runs. To merge more than two ASV tables, run the tool several times. 
    </p>
    
    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>
    As an input you can give two ASV tables:
    <ul>
        <li>An ASV table saved as a .Rda file, which is the output from the tool "Make an ASV table and remove chimeras". Name: seqtab_nochim.Rda</li> 
        <li>When merging more than two ASV tables: a merged ASV table as an .Rda object, which is produced in a previous merging step with this tool. Name: seqtab_merged.Rda</li> 
      </ul>
    <br>
    Error rate estimations can depend on the sequencing run or the sequencing machine. When analyzing data from multiple sequencing runs, it is therefore recommended to  carry out sample inference
    independently for each run, and combine the resulting ASV tables.
    <br>
    <br>
    When merging more than two ASV tables, first merge two ASV tables. Then, give the resulting merged ASV table as one of the inputs files.
    <br>
    </p>
  
    <h3>Output</h3>
    <p>
    The analysis output consists of the following:
    <ul>
        <li>seqtab_merged.Rda: An object of matching the merged sequence table saved as .Rda file. It's the output of the mergeSequenceTables() function </li>
        <li>summary.txt: Text file to see how many ASVs and samples there are in the merged ASV table</li>
        <li>sequence_table_merged.tsv: The sequence (ASV) table produced after the mergeSequenceTables() function printed out in a .tsv file. The column names/names of each ASV sequence are being edited to asv0, asv1... to make it easier to investigate the table.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
