<h2>Merge two ASV tables</h2>

  <h3>Description</h3>
  
  <p>
    When analyzing data from multiple sequencing runs with DADA2, it is recommended to carry out sample inference and combine reads into 
    contigs independently for each run with the same settings. This is because error rate estimations can depend on the sequencing run or 
    the sequencing machine. After that, the resulting ASV tables are merged with this tool.
    <br>
    <br>
    When merging more than two ASV tables, first merge two ASV tables. Then, give the resulting merged ASV table as one of the inputs files.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>
    As an input you can give two ASV tables:
    <ul>
        <li>An ASV table saved as a .Rda file, which is the output from the tool "Make an ASV table and remove chimeras". Name: seqtab_nochim.Rda</li> 
        <li>When merging more than two ASV tables: a merged ASV table as an .Rda object, which is produced in a previous merging step with this tool. Name: seqtab_merged.Rda</li> 
      </ul>
    </p>
  
    <h3>Output</h3>
    <p>
    The analysis output consists of the following:
    <ul>
        <li>seqtab_merged.Rda: An object of matching the merged sequence table saved as .Rda file. It's the output of the mergeSequenceTables() function </li>
        <li>summary.txt: Text file to see how many ASVs and samples there are in the merged ASV table</li>
        <li>sequence_table_merged.tsv: The sequence (ASV) table produced after the mergeSequenceTables() function printed out in a .tsv file. The column names/names of each ASV sequence are being edited to asv0, asv1... to make it easier to investigate the table.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
