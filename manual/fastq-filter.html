<h2>Filter contigs based on the number of expected errors</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
    Discards sequences which have more than the user specified number of expected errors. 
    This tool helps to filter bad quality contigs after the paired reads have been merged in contigs
    with the tool "Combine paired reads to contigs with Vsearch".
</p>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Discard sequences with more than the specified number of expected errors. Decimal number from 0 - , The default value is 1</li>
</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>
<p>
This tool takes a tar-package of FastQ files which have been created with tool "Combine paired reads to contigs with Vsearch"
<br> It filters the samples and discards those reads which have more than the user specified number of expected errors. It calculates the number of expected errors.
<br>
This tools helps to filter bad quality reads.
For more information about expected error, you can check this USEARCH manual page <a href="https://drive5.com/usearch/manual/exp_errs.html">Expected errors predicted by Phred (Q) scores</a>.
<br> This page suggests to use 1 as the treshold, but it can be made sticter. But be aware not to discard too many sequences.
<br>
For more information about the calculations and formulas to calculate the number of expected errors, you can check this 
article by Robert C. Edgar and Henrik Flyvbjerg <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/31/21/3476/194979#btv401-M8">Error filtering, pair assembly and error correction for next-generation sequencing reads</a>.

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
The analysis output consists of the following:
<ul>
    <li>filtered_contigs.tar: A Tar-package consisting all the merged FastQ files which have been filtered. One FastQ file from one sample/pair. </li>
    <li>summary.tsv: Summary statistics, which show how many sequences have been discarded from each sample.</li>
</ul>
