<h2>Filter sequences based on the number of expected errors</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
    Discards sequences which have more than the user specified number of expected errors. 
    This tool helps to filter bad quality sequences, for example contigs made by merging paired reads with VSEARCH. 
</p>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Discard sequences with more than the specified number of expected errors. Decimal (0 -) [1]</li>
</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>
<p>
This tool takes a Tar package of FASTQ files, for example contigs created with tool "Combine paired reads to contigs with VSEARCH".
<br> It filters out those sequences which have more than the user specified number of expected errors.
<br>
For more information about expected error, you can check this USEARCH manual page <a href="https://drive5.com/usearch/manual/exp_errs.html">Expected errors predicted by Phred (Q) scores</a>.
<br> This page suggests to use 1 as the threshold, but it can be made stricter.
<br>

<br>
<br>
This tools is based on the fastq_filter command of VSEARCH package.
</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
The analysis output consists of the following:
<ul>
    <li>filtered_contigs.tar: A Tar package consisting of FASTQ files containing filtered sequences. One FASTQ file per sample. </li>
    <li>summary.tsv: Summary statistics, which show how many sequences have been discarded from each sample.</li>
</ul>
