    <h2>HISAT2 for single end reads with own genome</h2>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This tool aligns Illumina single end RNA-seq reads to a genome provided either as a FASTA format sequence or as a
        tar package with a HISAT2 index.
        You need to supply the reads in one or more FASTQ files.
    </p>

    <h3>Parameters</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>RNA-strandness (unstranded, F, R) [unstranded]</li>
        <li>How many hits is a read allowed to have (1-1000000) [5]</li>
        <li>Base quality encoding used (phred+33, phred+64) [phred+33]</li>
        <li>Minimum intron length [20]</li>
        <li>Maximum intron length [500000]</li>
        <li>Allow soft clipping (yes, no) [yes] </li>
        <li>Are long anchors required (yes, no) [no]</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>
        HISAT2 (hierarchical indexing for spliced alignment of transcripts) is a highly efficient system for aligning
        reads from RNA sequencing experiments.
        HISAT2 uses an indexing scheme based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform and the Ferragina-Manzini (FM) index,
        employing two types of indexes for alignment:
        a whole-genome FM index to anchor each alignment and numerous local FM indexes for very rapid extensions of
        these alignments.
        HISAT's hierarchical index for the human genome contains 48,000 local FM indexes, each representing a genomic
        region of ~64,000 bp.
    </p>
    <p>
        HISAT2 searches by default for up to 5 distinct, primary alignments for each read, but you can change this
        number.
        Primary alignments mean alignments whose alignment score is equal or higher than any other alignments. It is
        possible that multiple distinct alignments have the same score.
        Note that HISAT2 does not "find" alignments in any specific order, so for reads that have more than 5 distinct,
        valid alignments,
        HISAT2 does not guarantee that the 5 alignments reported are the best possible in terms of alignment score.
        By default soft clipping is allowed, meaning that the ends of the read don't need to align if this increases the
        alignment score.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are planning to do transcriptome assembly afterwards, you should set the long anchor parameter to yes.
        With this option, HISAT2 requires longer anchor lengths for de novo discovery of splice sites. This leads to
        fewer alignments with short anchors, which helps transcript assemblers improve significantly in computation and
        memory usage.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you use a FASTA format genome, the tool will produce a .tar file with the HISAT2 indexes. If you run the tool
        again with the same genome, you should use the .tar file as the genome input, as this saves the time needed
        to generate the indexes.

    <p>After running HISAT2, Chipster indexes the BAM file using the <a

    <h3>Output</h3>
    <p>
        This tool returns the following files:
        <ul>
            <li>*.bam: BAM file containing the alignments</li>
            <li>*.bam.bai: Index for the BAM file</li>
            <li>hisat.log: Summary of the alignment results</li>
            <li>*.hisat2.tar: HISAT2 index as a tar package (only if FASTA genome provided)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
