<h2>Precluster aligned sequences with Mothur</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
Given a fasta-formatted alignment and a count file or names file, this tool pre-clusters sequences in order to remove sequences 
that are likely to contain sequencing errors.
</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

Number of differences allowed [1]

<h3>Details</h3>
<p>
The basic idea is that abundant sequences are more likely to generate erroneous sequences than rare sequences. 
With that in mind, the algorithm proceeds by ranking sequences in order of their abundance. 
It then walks through the list of sequences looking for rarer sequences that are within 
one or more mismatch for every 100 bases of the original sequence. 
Those that are within this threshold are merged with the larger sequence. 
By pre-clustering you remove a large number of sequences making the distance calculation much faster. 
</p>
<p>
You can allow more mismatches per 100 bases by tuning the <b>Number of differences allowed</b> parameter.
</p>
<p>
This tool is based on the <a href="http://www.mothur.org/wiki/Pre.cluster">Pre.cluster</a> command of the Mothur package.
</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>The analysis output consists of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>preclustered.fasta: Alignment with preclustered sequences</li> 
<li>preclustered-summary.tsv: Summary statistics for the alignment </li> 
<li>preclustered.count: Count file with preclustered sequences </li>
</ul>
