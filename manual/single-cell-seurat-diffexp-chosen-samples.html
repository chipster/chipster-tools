    <h2>Seurat -Find DE genes between chosen samples </h2>

    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
        For a given cluster, this tool gives you the differentially expressed genes between the samples/conditions
        listed by the user.
        Conditions/samples are determined in the Setup tool with the Sample or Group name parameter.
        If you are listing multiple samples, separate them with comma (,).
    </p>

    <h3>Parameters</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Name of the samples to compare to</li>
        <li>Name of the samples to compare with</li>
        <li>Name of the cluster [3]</li>
        <li>Return only positive marker genes [TRUE]</li>
        <li>Fold change threshold for differentially expressed genes in log scale [0.25]</li>
        <li>Adjusted p-value cutoff for differentially expressed genes [0.05]</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Details</h3>

    <p>
        As inputs, give the combined Seurat object. <br>
    </p>

    <p>
        Select the cluster you want to inspect by setting its name in the parameter field. As an example, the parameter
        is set to cluster "3".
    </p>

    <p>
        Select the samples or list of samples which you want to compare to each other by typing the sample names
        to the parameter fields. If you are listing multiple samples, use comma as separator: for example,
        type: "CTRL, CTRL_2" (withouth the hyphens "") in first field and "STIM, STIM_2" in the second.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can filter the differentially expressed genes using the parameters. By
        default, only genes with
        adjusted p-value < 0.05 are listed in the result table and only positive markers are kept. Note that Seurat
            adjusts p-values using the rather conserved Bonferroni method for multiple testing correction. </p>
            <p>You can choose to include in the analysis only genes whose average fold change is higher than a selected
                value. This prefiltering speeds up the analysis
                and narrows down the result list.
            </p>
            <p>The result table contains the genes which are differentially expressed between the
                conditions in the selected cluster. The columns include
            <ul>
                <li><b>p_val</b> = p-values for the differentially expressed genes (larger the p-value -> higher the
                    likelihood that the gene is in the list just be chance) </li>
                <li><b>p_val_adj</b> = adjusted p-value. This value is corrected for multiple testing:
                    when we test thousands of genes, we can get some statistically significantly
                    differentially expressed genes just by chance. There are different methods to correct for this,
                    Seurat uses the Bonferroni method. When filtering the table and reporting your results,
                    use this value.</li>
                <li><b>avg_logFC</b> = average log2 fold change (how much higher or lower the expression of this gene is
                    in the chosen cluster between the conditions </li>
                <li><b>pct.1</b> = what percentage of the cells in the condition 1 show some expression for this gene.
                    Note, that numbering is based on alphabets: earlier in the alphabets -> 1, the other one -> 2.
                    So for example, "CTRL" -> 1 and "STIM" -> 2, since C is before S in alphabets.
                </li>
                <li><b>pct.2</b> = what percentage of the cells in the condition 2 show some expression for this gene
                </li>
            </ul>
    </p>
