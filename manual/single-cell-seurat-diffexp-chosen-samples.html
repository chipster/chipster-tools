    <h2>Seurat -Find differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between chosen samples </h2>

    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
        For a given cluster, this tool provides a list of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) based on the conditions of the samples.
        Conditions and samples are selected in the Setup tool, using the Sample or Group name parameter.
        If you are listing multiple samples, separate them using comma(s) (,).
    </p>

    <h3>Parameters</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Name of the samples to compare to</li>
        <li>Name of the samples to compare with</li>
        <li>Name of the cluster [3]</li>
        <li>Return only positive marker genes [TRUE]</li>
        <li>Fold change threshold for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in log scale [0.25]</li>
        <li>Adjusted p-value cutoff for differentially expressed genes [0.05]</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Details</h3>

    <p>
        Please input the combined Seurat object. <br>
    </p>

    <p>
        Select the cluster you would like to inspect by setting its name in the parameter field. As an example, the parameter
        is set to cluster "3".
    </p>

    <p>
        Select the sample(s) which you would like to compare with one another by typing the sample names
        in the parameter fields. If you are listing multiple samples, use a comma (,) as a separator: for example,
        type: <i>CTRL, CTRL_2</i> in first field and <i>STIM, STIM_2</i> in the second field.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can filter the DEGs using the parameters. By
        default, only genes with
        adjusted p-values of less than 0.05 are listed in the results table and only positive markers are kept. Please note that Seurat
            adjusts p-values using the Bonferroni method for multiple testing correction.</p>
            <p>Alternatively, you can choose to include only genes whose average fold change is higher than a selected
                value. This prefiltering accelerates the analysis
                and generates fewer DEGs in the results list.
            </p>
            <p>The results table contains DEGs in the selected cluster. The columns include:
            <ul>
                <li><b>p_val</b> = p-values for DEGs (larger the p-value -> higher the
                    likelihood that the gene is in the list just by chance) </li>
                <li><b>p_val_adj</b> = adjusted p-value. This value is generated after applying multiple testing correction.
                    When thousands of genes are tested, some DEGs are generated by chance. While different methods exist to correct for this,
                    Seurat uses the Bonferroni method. When filtering the table and reporting results,
                    please use this value.</li>
                <li><b>avg_logFC</b> = average log2 fold change (how much higher or lower the expression of this gene is
                    in the chosen cluster between conditions) </li>
                <li><b>pct.1</b> = what percentage of the cells in condition 1 show some expression for this gene.
                    Please note, numbering is based on alphabetical order: earlier in the alphabets -> 1, the other one -> 2.
                    For example, <i>CTRL</i> -> 1 and <i>STIM</i> -> 2, as the letter C comes before S when alphabetized.
                </li>
                <li><b>pct.2</b> = what percentage of the cells in condition 2 show some expression for this gene
                </li>
            </ul>
    </p>
