	<h2>Seurat -Find conserved cluster markers and DE genes in multiple samples </h2>

	<h3>Description</h3>

	<p>
		For a given cluster this tool gives youÂ 
	<ul>
		<li> the cell type markers that are conserved across all the conditions (conserved_markers.tsv)</li>
		<li> differentially expressed genes of each sample compared to all the other
			samples (de-list_samplenameVsAllOthers.tsv)</li>
	</ul>
	Samples are determined in the Setup tool with the Sample or Group name parameter.
	</p>

	<h3>Parameters</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Normalisation method used previously [Global scaling normalization]</li>
		<li>Name of the cluster [3]</li>
		<li>Return only positive marker genes [TRUE]</li>
		<li>Fold change threshold for conserved markers in log2 scale [0.25]</li>
		<li>Fold change threshold for differentially expressed genes in log2 scale [0.25]</li>
		<li>Adjusted p-value cutoff for conserved markers [0.05]</li>
		<li>Adjusted p-value cutoff for differentially expressed genes [0.05]</li>
		<li>Minimum number of cells in one of the groups for conserved markers [3]</li>
		<li>Minimum number of cells in one of the groups for conserved markers [3]</li>
		<li>Limit testing for differentially expressed genes to genes which are expressed in at least this fraction of
			cells [0.1]</li>
		<li>Limit testing for conserved markers to genes which are expressed in at least this fraction of cells [0.1]
		</li>
	</ul>


	<h3>Details</h3>

	<p>
		As inputs, give the combined Seurat object. <br>
	</p>

	<p>
		Select the cluster you want to inspect by setting its name in the parameter field. As an example, the parameter
		is set to cluster "3".
	</p>

	<p>
		You can filter both the conserved marker genes and the differentially expressed genes using the parameters. By
		default, only genes with
		adjusted p-value < 0.05 are listed in the result table and only positive markers are kept. Note that Seurat
			adjusts p-values using the rather conserved Bonferroni method for multiple testing correction. </p>
			<p>You can choose to include in the analysis only genes whose average fold change is higher than a selected
				value. This prefiltering speeds up the analysis
				and narrows down the result list.
			</p>
			<p>The result tables <b>de-list_samplenamevsAllOthers.tsv</b> contain the genes which are differentially
				expressed between the two
				conditions in the selected cluster. The columns in these files
				include:
			<ul>
				<li><b>p_val</b> = p-values for the differentially expressed genes (larger the p-value -> higher the
					likelihood that the gene is in the list just be chance) </li>
				<li><b>p_val_adj</b> = adjusted p-value. This value is corrected for multiple testing:
					when we test thousands of genes, we can get some statistically significantly
					differentially expressed genes just by chance. There are different methods to correct for this,
					Seurat uses the Bonferroni method. When filtering the table and reporting your results,
					use this value.</li>
				<li><b>avg_logFC</b> = Log fold-chage of the average expression between the two groups.
					Positive values indicate that the gene is more highly expressed in the first group. First group =
					first in the alphabets. </li>
				<li><b>pct.1</b> = what percentage of the cells in the condition 1 show some expression for this gene.
					Note, that numbering is based on alphabets: earlier in the alphabets -> 1, the other one -> 2.
					So for example, "CTRL" -> 1 and "STIM" -> 2, since C is before S in alphabets.
				</li>
				<li><b>pct.2</b> = what percentage of the cells in the condition 2 show some expression for this gene
				</li>
				<li><b>aver_expr columns</b> = Average expression of the cells in this cluster in the listed samples.
				</li>
			</ul>
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>conserved_markers.tsv</b> contains a ranked list of conserved marker genes for the chosen cluster
		(= genes that show specific expression in this particular cell type/cluster, regardless of the treatment).
		This file has as many column groups as there are samples in the data.
		In addition to the columns listed above, this table contains also the following columns:
	<ul>
		<li> max_pval = maximum p-value of the samples</li>
		<li> minimum_pval = minimum p-value of the samples</li>
		<li> max.adj.pval = maximum adjusted p-value of the samples (note: this value needs to be < p-value threshold
				set in the parameters, default:0.05)</li>
		<li> minimum.adj.pval = minimum adjusted p-value of the samples</li>

	</ul>
	</p>

	<h3>Output</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>conserved_markers.tsv: Conserved cell type markers across the conditions </li>
		<li>several de-list_samplenameVsAllOthers.tsv files: Differentially expressed genes between each sample and
			all other samples</li>
	</ul>
