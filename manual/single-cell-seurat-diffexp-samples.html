	<h2>Seurat -Find conserved cluster markers and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in multiple samples </h2>

	<h3>Description</h3>

	<p>
		For a given cluster, this tool provides the following information:
	<ul>
		<li> cell type markers conserved across all conditions (conserved_markers.tsv)</li>
		<li> differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between conditions (de-list.tsv) </li>
	</ul>
	OR, in case of more than two samples:
	
	<br><br>
	<ul>
		<li> DEGs of each sample compared to all other
			samples (de-list_samplenameVsAllOthers.tsv) </li>
	
	</ul>
	Both conditions and samples are determined using the Setup tool when using the Sample or Group name parameter.
	</p>

	<h3>Parameters</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Name of the cluster [3]</li>
		<li>Return only positive marker genes [TRUE]</li>
		<li>Fold change threshold for conserved markers in log2 scale [0.25]</li>
		<li>Fold change threshold for DEGs in log2 scale [0.25]</li>
		<li>p-value cutoff for conserved markers [0.05]</li>
		<li>Adjusted p-value cutoff for DEGs [0.05]</li>
		<li>Minimum number of cells in one of the groups for conserved markers [3]</li>
	</ul>


	<h3>Details</h3>

	<p>
		Please provide the combined Seurat object. <br>
	</p>

	<p>
		Select the cluster you would like to inspect by setting its name in the parameter field. As an example, the parameter
		is set to cluster "3".
	</p>

	<p>
		You can filter both the conserved marker genes and the DEGs using the parameters. By
		default, only genes with
		adjusted p-values of less than 0.05 are listed in the results table. Additionally, only positive markers are kept. Please note that Seurat
			adjusts p-values using the Bonferroni method for multiple testing correction. </p>
			<p>In the analysis, you can opt to include only genes whose average log fold change is higher than a selected
				value. This prefiltering speeds up the analysis
				and narrows down the result list.
			</p>
			<p>The result table <b>de-list.tsv</b> contains genes which are differentially expressed (DE) between the two
				conditions in the selected cluster. In case of more than 2 samples, there will be as many
				files as there are samples, named <b>de-list_samplenamevsAllOthers.tsv</b>. The columns in these files
				include:
			<ul>
				<li><b>p_val</b> = p-values for the DEGs (if the p-value is larger, there is a greater likelihood that
				 the gene is in the list just by chance) </li>
				<li><b>p_val_adj</b> = adjusted p-value. This value is corrected using multiple testing correction:
					when we test thousands of genes, we may identify some DEGs just by chance. There are different methods to correct for this,
					and Seurat specifically uses the Bonferroni method. When filtering the table and reporting your results,
					please use these values.</li>
				<li><b>avg_logFC</b> = average log2 fold change (how much higher or lower the expression of this gene is
					in the chosen cluster between conditions) </li>
				<li><b>pct.1</b> = the percentage of the cells in condition 1 show some expression for this gene.
					Please note: numbering is based on alphabetical order: earlier in the alphabets -> 1, the other one -> 2.
					So for example, "CTRL" -> 1 and "STIM" -> 2, since C is before S in the English alphabet.
				</li>
				<li><b>pct.2</b> = the percentage of cells in condition 2 show some expression for this gene
				</li>
			</ul>
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>conserved_markers.tsv</b> contains a ranked list of conserved marker genes for the chosen cluster
		(= genes that show specific expression in this particular cell type or cluster, regardless of the treatment).
		This file has as many column groups as number of samples in the data.
		In addition to the columns listed above, this table contains the following columns:
	<ul>
		<li> max_pval = maximum unadjusted p-value of the samples</li>
		<li> min_pval = minimum unadjusted p-value of the samples</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<h3>Output</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>conserved_markers.tsv: Conserved cell type markers across conditions </li>
		<li>de-list.tsv: DEGs between conditions </li>
	</ul>
	OR
	
	<ul>
		<li>several de-list_samplenameVsAllOthers.tsv files: DEGs between each sample and
			all other samples</li>
	</ul>
