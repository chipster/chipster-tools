    <h1>Read counts and alignments -terminology and how to read to results </h1>

    <p>
        Aligning is a crucial step in many kinds of sequence/sequencing analyses.
        Aligning reads or any pieces of sequence to a reference genome is not a trivial task,
        and many aligners have been developed over the years for different needs.
        Some aligners tend to be used a lot and thus even get a “gold standard” stamp,
        but the field is still developing quickly.
    </p>

    <p>
        <a href="https://www.ecseq.com/support/ngs/what-is-the-best-ngs-alignment-software.html">Which is the best
            aligner? Read more here!</a>
        <br>Spoiler: no single aligner is the best: it depends on goals, sequencing technology used, species,
        computational constraints…

    </p>
    Aligners differ in speed, memory requirements, accuracy, ability to deal with spliced reads
    (important with RNAseq data of eukaryotes), how they cope with very short or very long reads etc.
    In Chipster we offer a couple of aligners, some of which work for RNA-seq (splice-aware).
    For some we have ready-made reference genomes and index files, and for some you can also use your own.
    Some tools allow outputting the reads that didn’t align to a fastq file, which can be handy,
    when you want to filter sequences that DON’T align for example to a host genome,
    ribosomal sequences etc -this is the case with Bowtie aligners.

    <h2>Alignment terminology </h2>

    <p>
        There are a couple of terms that one needs to understand when studying the aligners further.
    </p>

    <p>
        Firstly, you need to know if your data was sequenced <b>paired-end (PE)</b> or <b>single-end (SE)</b>,
        and whether it was produced with a <b>directional protocol</b>.
        The latter is dealt with a parameter in those tools that can take that into account,
        whereas paired-end and single-end tools are usually separate tools in Chipster,
        and the command syntax is different in the command line tools.
    </p>

    <p>
        Aligning reads is not always straightforward: in an ideal case, your read aligns perfectly
        to exactly one location in the reference genome. In this case you would be absolutely sure
        that the read originated from this exact location. If you think this claim any further,
        you will realize that this can be said with absolute certainty in very rare cases:
        your read might have sequencing errors, it might not be that long (not that much evidence,
        same sequence could be present elsewhere in the reference), there might be some
        mutations/variants/indels/SNPs present, the reference might not be aware of all the
        splice sites and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you decide to take into account only those reads that map without mismatches
        to exactly one location in the reference genome,
        you are tossing away lots of reads because of the aforementioned reasons.
        So you most likely want to allow some mismatches and gaps in the alignments, and this
        is done with the aligner (default) parameters, but it does raise a question:
        how trustworthy and uniquely mapping the <b>uniquely mapping reads (unireads)</b> actually are?
        Aligners go around this issue using <b>aligning scores</b>, more of which later.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b> Ambiguous</b> means that the read maps to location where there’s more than one gene.
        Nowadays many of the library preparation methods can preserve the information from which
        strand the read originally came from, which of course helps with the ambiguous situations.
        These methods are called <b>directional</b> or <b>stranded</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The situation gets a bit more complex when dealing with paired-end reads,
        as also their orientation and distance between the read pairs (<b>inner distance</b>) affect
        how they are treated and reported, or only one of the pairs might be mapping (<b>“singleton”</b>).
        If reads are aligned <b>“concordantly”</b>, it means that they meet the expectations:
        usually this means that R1 is in forward direction and R2 in reverse, and the distance between
        the reads is in the range of 500bp.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>“Discordant”</b> reads don’t match this criteria, and it depends on the chosen aligner
        parameters how these reads are treated.
    </p>

    <p>
        <a href="https://chipster.csc.fi/manual/library-type-summary.html"> More information about directional
            protocols</a>

    <h2>Alignment scores or mapping qualities -such a mess? </h2>

    <p>
        <b>Alignment quality score</b> (or <b>mapping quality</b>, <b>MapQ</b>) can be expressed
        similarly as the base qualities, in Phred scores: Q = -10 * log10
        (probability that mapping location is wrong). However, there’s really no sensible way to
        compute this likelihood, so mappers have their own systems for trying to give a numerical
        value for the confidence in read’s point of origin. The value is computed differently in
        different aligners, and depends on things like:
    <ul>
        <li>uniqueness of the aligned region in the genome </li>
        <li>length of alignment </li>
        <li>number of mismatches and gaps </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        So the values differ in different aligners, and they are thus not comparable. For example, quality for unique
        mapping is:
    <ul>
        <li>60 in HISAT2 </li>
        <li>255 in STAR </li>
        <li>50 in TopHat </li>
    </ul>
    Further on, in Tophat / Bowtie:
    <ul>
        <li> 255 = unique mapping </li>
        <li>3 = maps to 2 locations in the target </li>
        <li>2 = maps to 3 locations </li>
        <li>1 = maps to 4-9 locations </li>
        <li>0 = maps to 10 or more locations. </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        These values can however be used in filtering the alignments, both inside the aligner and later on.
        Users must be careful with the default values and ready-made pipelines, because these values
        are not comparable between different aligners.
    </p>

    <p>
        Different aligners allow users to tune the values affecting the alignment score, as well as what
        happens to reads with lower alignment scores: how are they reported and how are they outputted.
        For example, Bowtie2 reports only the "best" alignment (based on the score) by default,
        you can choose to output unaligned reads* to a fastq file and you can tune the penalties and
        bonuses for different things.
    </p>

    <h2>Understanding the alignment reports </h2>

    <p>
        Below you can see couple of reports or “log files” from different aligners.
        From the number of input reads you can figure that they are from the same SE data.
        Different aligners report the alignment a bit differently, and also perform slightly differently.
    </p>

    <h3>Bowtie2: </h3>
    <img src="aligners-comparison-images/Bowtie2.png">

    <h3>TopHat2: </h3>
    <img src="aligners-comparison-images/TopHat2.png">

    <h3>HISAT2: </h3>
    <img src="aligners-comparison-images/HISAT.png">

    <h3>STAR: </h3>
    <img src="aligners-comparison-images/STAR.png">

    <p>
        The example cases above are from single-end reads. The situation gets a bit more complex when
        dealing with paired-end reads, as also their orientation and distance between the read pairs
        (inner distance) affect how they are treated and reported, or only one of the pairs might be
        mapping (“singleton”). (See the terminology section above.)
    </p>

    <p>
        Here you can see example reports of paired-end data. These are now actually from a
        rather curious case, which you'll notice if you look at the unusually low alignment rate!
    </p>

    <h3>Bowtie 2, paired-end: </h3>
    <img src="aligners-comparison-images/Bowtie_2_paired_end.png">

    <h3>HISAT2, paired-end: </h3>
    <img src="aligners-comparison-images/HISAT2_paired_end.png">

    <p>
        This table can be a bit tricky to read. First lines are seemingly clear: there were 200 000 reads
        (this is a toy dataset), all of which were paired (the input fastq files had the same amount of
        reads in them, which is the usual case). 68.62 % of these were uniquely and concordantly aligned
        -they are the obviously good ones.
    </p>

    <p>
        What about the rest (31.38%)? Small percentage (4.25%) were “multimappers”, so they aligned to more
        than one location. Bigger portion, 27.13%, aligned concordantly 0 times, but out of them, some aligned
        discordantly 1 time (mid section in the report). These might represent some large insertions (making
        the inner distance between the read pairs longer than expected) or other larger difference in the sample
        compared to the reference genome.
    </p>

    <p>
        Out of those reads that didn’t align concordantly or discordantly (54 257 – 8734 = 45 523), similar
        numbers are reported per each read mate: in the last section of the report, we are looking at single
        reads, not pairs (2 x 45 523 read pairs = 91 046 reads). So regardless where or how the other read is
        or is not aligning, the other pair aligned uniquely in 15 029 cases and more than once in 1800 cases.
        Out of all the reads, 81.52% didn’t simply align at all.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thus we get an overall alignment rate of 81.45%: this consists of all the single reads that align at
        least once (no matter if they are multimappers, if the other pair of the read pair didn’t map as expected
        or at all). The formula to get this number out of the reported numbers above is:
        (137241*2+8502*2+8734*2+15029+1800)/(2*200000) = 81.45%.
    </p>

    <p>
        Note, that from this table, we cannot say how many alignments there were in total, as it is not
        reported here, how many alignments there were in those cases where there are more than 1:
        the multimappers can map to 2, 5, 30… locations. HTSeq will give you the number of alignments, or you
        can check it with <a href="https://chipster.rahtiapp.fi/manual/rseqc.html">RSeQC</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Counting the reads: comparison to HTSeq counts</h2>

    <p>
        The table below is the HTSeq log file (htseq-count-info.txt) from the same SE data as the example
        alignment reports above. You can see that the number of input reads reported by each aligner (86 568)
        or the number of mapped reads (70 000 -80 000, depending on the aligner and what is reported) is less
        than the “total” in the HTSeq report below (99 452). This is because <b>HTSeq reports alignments,
            not the reads</b>. Some reads map to multiple locations, so the number of alignments is often higher
        than the number of reads.
    </p>

    <h3>HTSeq report: </h3>
    <img src="aligners-comparison-images/HTSeq.png">

    <p>
        Some aligners report also the number of <b>multimappers</b> (sometimes called also <b>multireads</b>).
    </p>

    <p>
        HTSeq reports how many alignments it got from the input BAM file (the total sum),
        and how many of these were actually counted. This number depends on the HTSeq parameters,
        like what mapping quality is required and how the ambiguous reads are treated (HTSeq has three options
        for this, see the <a href="https://htseq.readthedocs.io/en/master/count.html#count">HTSeq manual page</a>) and
        what
        alignment quality is required for reads to be counted (higher requirement for quality means that
        more reads are skipped, so more are reported as “not counted”: if lower value is used, some of
        these reads are however caught as ambiguous ´).
    </p>
