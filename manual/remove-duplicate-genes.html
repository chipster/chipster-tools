<h2>Remove duplicate genes</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

This tool takes a list of gene identifiers and removes duplicates. The output file is compatible with downstream tools used for example for pathway analysis.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Parameters</h3>

<ul>
<li>ID column</li>
</ul>

<br>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The identifier column can be selected from the parameter. If the file contains a column called ensembl_id, it will be selected by default.</p> 

<p>If the same gene appears on several rows, the first row is kept and the others are removed. 
	However, if the file has a column called location (e.g. for ChIP-seq data), then its values affect which row among the same IDs is kept. 
	The values are prioritised as follows:</p>

<ul>
    <li>upstream</li>
	<li>overlapStart</li>
	<li>inside</li>
	<li>overlapEnd</li>
	<li>downstream</li>
    <li>any other value</li> 
</ul>

<br>
<h3>Output</h3>

<p>The analysis output is a table of annotated genes, which is compatible with downstream tools used for example for pathway analysis.</p>

<p>The file rows are sorted according to the text in the ID column.</p>
