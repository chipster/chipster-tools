		<h2>Seurat v4 -From RDS file to Seurat object</h2>

		<h3>Description</h3>

			<p>
				This tool converts an RDS file into a Seurat object.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The RDS file given as input must contain Seurat object information created with Seurat version 4 
				to be converted into a Seurat object. 
			</p>
				
			<p>
				This tool is useful in situations where single-cell RNA-seq data has been previously analyzed with
				Seurat v4 and then saved as an RDS file. By converting the RDS file back into a Seurat object with
				this tool, the analysis can be continued in Chipster.
			</p>

		<h3>Details</h3>

			<p>
				Note that the single-cell RNA-seq tools in Chipster assume that you have analyzed your data 
				similarly as how it is done in Chipster. Therefore, you might need some meta data in your 
				Seurat object in order to continue the analysis in Chipster. You can use the 
				<a href="https://chipster.rahtiapp.fi/manual/single-cell-extract-information.html">Seurat v4 
				-Extract information from Seurat object</a> tool to see what meta data has been stored in your 
				Seurat object. Assuming that you have necessary meta data, you can continue your analysis using other single-cell RNA-seq tools.
			</p>

		<h3>Output</h3>

			<ul>
				<li>seurat_obj.Robj: The Seurat R-object to pass to the next Seurat tool.  </li>
			</ul>
