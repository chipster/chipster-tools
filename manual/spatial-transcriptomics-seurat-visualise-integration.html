	<h2>Seurat v4 -Visualise integration</h2>

	<h3>Description</h3>

	<p>
		This tool visualises the results of the "Seurat v4 -Integration with single-cell data".
		This tool plots the chosen features with SpatialFeaturePlot. It also identifies and visualises the top expressed spatially variable features computed using the markvariogram.
	</p>

	<h3>Details</h3>

	<p>
		The spatially variable features are computed similarly as in the tool "Seurat v4 -Identify spatially variable features using markvariogram" except with prediction scores as the “marks” rather than gene expression. These features are then visualised in the SpatialPlot.
	</p>

	<p>
		As an input, give the Seurat object generated with "Seurat v4 -Integration with single-cell data".
	</p>

	<h3>Output</h3>
