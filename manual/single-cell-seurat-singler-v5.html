    <h2>SingleR cluster annotation </h2>

    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
        This tool can be used to annotate clustered scRNAseq data by comparing it to
        the CellDex annotation datasets.

    </p>

    <h3>Parameters</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>CellDex reference to use [Monaco Immune data]</li>
        <li>Point size in plot [1]</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Details</h3>

    <p>
        SingleR is an automatic annotation method for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq)
        data (Aran et al. 2019).
        Given a reference dataset of samples (single-cell or bulk) with known labels,
        it labels new cells from a test dataset based on similarity to the reference.
        The CellDex package provides access to several reference datasets
        (mostly derived from bulk RNA-seq or microarray data) through dedicated retrieval functions.
        User can select the CellDex package to be used as reference.

        As inputs, give a Seurat object which includes the clustering information. <br>

    </p>
    <p>
        Main and fine annotations are done cell by cell, and this data is returned as tsv tables and in the
        Seurat object (in fields: seurat_obj@meta.data$annotation.main and seurat_obj@meta.data$annotation.fine).
        The annotation results are also shown in the pdf file as <b>UMAP plots</b>, together with heatmap and violin
        plots
        that can be used to estimate the confidence of the annotations. Before the main and fine annotations
        there's also the UMAP plot colored according the clustering result, and after that the annotations
        according the clusters.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <b>heatmaps</b> display the scores for all cells across all reference labels: ideally, each cell (=column)
        has one score that is much higher (=yellow) than the rest. Similar diagnostic can be viewed in the
        violion plots, where per cell "deltas" are shown. Deltas are the difference between the score for the highest
        label and the median across all labels for each cell.
