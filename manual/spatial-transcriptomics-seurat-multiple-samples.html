    <h2>Seurat v4 -Combine multiple samples </h2>

    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
        This tool can be used to merge or integrate multiple Seurat objects for downstream joint analysis.

    </p>

    <h3>Parameters</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Combining method [merge]</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Details</h3>

    <p>
        As inputs, give the Seurat objects generated with the <b>Seurat Setup tool</b> and
        preprocessed with the <b>SCTransform</b> tool. <br>
    </p>

    </p>

    <h4>Merge vs integration as the combining method</h4>

    <p>
        The <b>"combining method"</b> parameter determines which method is used to combine.
        By default, merge is used, but the user can also choose to use integration.
        Merge simply combines the objects into one.
    </p>

    <p>
        The integration method uses Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to identify common sources of variation across datasets.
        After this, the tool identifies anchors, generates scores (=weights) for these anchors
        and then uses the anchors to integrate the datasets.
        The integration method should be used to remove strong batch effects present in the data.

    <h3>Output</h3>

    <ul>

        <li>seurat_obj.Robj: The Seurat R-object to pass to the next Seurat tool, or to import into R, but not viewable in
            Chipster. </li>
    </ul>
