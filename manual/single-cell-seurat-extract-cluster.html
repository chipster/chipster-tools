<h2>Seurat -Extract cells in a cluster </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
This tool gives you a subset of the data: only those cells in a user defined cluster.

</p>
 
 <h3>Parameters</h3>
<ul>
		<li>Name of the cluster [3]</li>
</ul>
	
	
 <h3>Details</h3>
  
<p>
As inputs, give the Seurat object created AFTER clustering step: either after
<ul>
 	<li><b>Seurat v3 -Clustering and detection of cluster marker genes</b> tool,</li>
 	<li>or after <b>Seurat v3 -Integrated analysis of two samples</b> tool in case of two sample analysis. </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Select the cluster you want to inspect by setting its name in the parameter field. 
As an example, the parameter is set to cluster "3".
</p>

<p>
You can continue analysing this subsetted R-object by running the Seurat tools again;
in the case you started with a single sample 
(subsetting after <b>Seurat v3 -Clustering and detection of cluster marker genes</b> tool),
you can start with the filtering and finding variable genes, and continue from there.
<br>
If you started with a combined Seurat object of two samples
(subsetting after <b>Seurat v3 -Integrated analysis of two samples</b> tool),
you can continue by running the after <b>Seurat v3 -Integrated analysis of two samples</b> tool again.
</p>

<p>
Note that the cell filtering (number of genes per cell, mito%) done in the original dataset
effect this object as well.  
</p>


<h3>Output</h3>

<ul>
<li>seurat_obj_subset.Robj: The Seurat R-object containing only the cells in the chosen clustesr. Can be passed to the next Seurat tool, or imported to R. Not viewable in Chipster. </li>
<li>QCplots.pdf: Quality control plots (similar to the ones in Setup tool.)</li>
</ul>
