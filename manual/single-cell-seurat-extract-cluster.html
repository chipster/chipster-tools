<h2>Seurat -Extract cells in a cluster </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
This tool subsets the data by only extracting cells belonging to a user-defined cluster.

</p>
 
 <h3>Parameters</h3>
<ul>
		<li>Name of the cluster [3]</li>
</ul>
	
	
 <h3>Details</h3>
  
<p>
Please input the Seurat object created <i>after</i> one of the two clustering steps listed below:
<ul>
 	<li><b>Seurat v3 -Clustering and detection of cluster marker genes</b> tool</li>
 	<li><b>Seurat v3 -Integrated analysis of two samples</b> tool (used for two sample analysis)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Select the cluster you would like to inspect by setting its name in the parameter field. 
As an example, the parameter is set to cluster "3".
</p>

<p>
You can continue analysing this subsetted R-object by running the Seurat tools again;
in the case you started with a single sample 
(subsetting after <b>Seurat v3 -Clustering and detection of cluster marker genes</b> tool),
you can start by filtering and finding variable genes, and continue from there.
<br>
If you started with a combined Seurat object of two samples
(subsetting after <b>Seurat v3 -Integrated analysis of two samples</b> tool),
you can continue by running the same tool again.
</p>

<p>
Please note that the cell filtering (number of genes per cell, mito%) performed on the original dataset
impacts this object as well.  
</p>


<h3>Output</h3>

<ul>
<li>seurat_obj_subset.Robj: The Seurat R-object containing only the cells in the chosen cluster. This can be passed to the next Seurat tool, or imported into R, but is not viewable in Chipster.</li>
<li>QCplots.pdf: Quality control (QC) plots (similar to the ones in Setup tool)</li>
</ul>
