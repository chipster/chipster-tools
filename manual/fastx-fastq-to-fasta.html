<h2>Convert FASTQ to FASTA</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Given a FASTQ file, this tool converts it to FASTA format. 
Reads can be also filtered for unknown nucleotides (Ns), and sequence identifiers can be renamed as numbers.</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<ul>
<li>Remove sequences with unknown nucleotides (yes, no) [yes]</li>
<li>Rename sequence identifiers as numbers (yes, no) [no]</li>
<li>Write a log file (yes, no) [no]</li>
<li>Base quality encoding used (Sanger, Illumina GA v1.3-1.5) [Sanger]</li>

</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Converts FASTQ files to FASTA format. Note that the base quality information available in FASTQ format is not available in FASTA. 
If you decide to remove sequences which contain unknown nucleotides, you might like to get a log file indicating how many sequences were discarded.
</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>FASTA file containing the reads. </p>

<h3>Reference</h3>

This tool is based on the FASTQ-to-FASTA converter of the <a href="http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/">FASTX package</a>.
