<p>If you would like to use Chipster to analyze your data, you have three options:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <b>Setting up a Chipster server at your institute</b>. This is free of charge, but you need an IT person to help
        you and suitable computing resources to run the server. The actual installation is easy, because Chipster is
        available as a
        <a href="http://chipster.github.io/chipster/">ready-to-use virtual machine image</a>. If you have an IT support
        person but lack suitable computing resources, you can install and run the Chipster server free of charge in the
        <a href="https://github.com/chipster/chipster/wiki/FedCloudChipster">EGI Federated cloud</a>.
    </li>
    <br>

    <li>
        <b>Use our Chipster server at <a href="https://www.csc.fi/">CSC</a> in Finland.</b> This is free of charge for
        users from Finnish universities and government research institutes (for open research),
        but others need to pay for the computing time. However, free 3-week evaluation accounts are available for
        everybody. Please see below how you can get a user account.
        <ul>

                        Note, that users from Finnish universities and research institutes can use their
                        HAKA and VIRTU logins to access Chipster, so training accounts are not necessary.
                        However, we kindly ask you to inform us about your upcoming Chipster courses
                        (number of participants, type of analysis jobs) so that we can add computing resources
                        to the server if needed. Please email us (chipster (at) csc.fi) about your training needs.
