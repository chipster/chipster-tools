<h2>Make an ASV table and remove chimeras</h2>

  <h3>Description</h3>
  
  <p>
    This tool makes an ASV/sequence-table, removes chimeras and produces an output file
    to check how many reads were removed as chimeric sequences. 
    </p>
    
    <h3>Parameters</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Method to identify chimeras (consensus, pooled) [consensus]</li>  
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>
    As an input you can give:
    <ul>
        <li>If single end reads: The dada-class object as a .Rda file which is the output from the tool "Sample 
            inference". Name: dada_forward.Rda</li> 
        <li>If paired end reads: The .Rda object, which is the output from the tool "Combine paired reads to contigs with Dada2".
           Name: contigs.Rda</li> 
      </ul>
    <br>
    At first, this tool uses the makeSequenceTable() function to construct an ASV table, a higher-resolution version of the OTU table produced by traditional methods.
    <br>
    <br>
    The ASV table is used as the input for the removeBimeraDenovo() function which is a convenience interface for chimera removal.
    To the summary.txt file is printed how many ASVs was found before and after the chimera removal.
    <br>
    Chimeras are sequences formed from two or more biological sequences joined together.
    Amplicons with chimeric sequences can form during PCR when closely related sequences are amplified. 
    The majority of chimeras are believed to arise from incomplete extension: During subsequent cycles of PCR, a partially extended strand can bind to a template derived from a different but similar sequence.
    This then acts as a primer that is extended to form a chimeric sequence.
    <br>
    <br>
    With removeBimeraDenovo() chimeric sequences are identified if they 
    can be exactly reconstructed by combining a left-segment and a right-segment from two more abundant “parent” sequences.
    <br>
    A bimera is a two-parent chimera, in which the left side is made up of one parent sequence,
    and the right-side made up of a second parent sequence.
    <br>
    If the method is consensus, the samples in the ASV table are independently checked for
    bimeras, and a consensus decision on each sequence variant is made. It runs the isBimeraDenovoTable() function.
    <br>
    If the method is pooled, the samples in the ASV table are all pooled together for bimera
    identification. It runs the isBimeraDenovo() function.
    <br>
    <br>
    At last, the number of reads which made it through the chimera removal, are printed to the reads_summary.tsv table and 
    the number of ASV sequences removed as bimeric is printed to the summary.txt file.
    <br>
    If most of your reads are removed as chimeric, upstream processing may need to be revisited. 
    In many cases this is caused by primer sequences with ambiguous nucleotides that were not
    removed prior to beginning the DADA2 pipeline.
    </p>
  
    <h3>Output</h3>
    <p>
    The analysis output consists of the following:
    <ul>
        <li>seqtab.nochim: An object of matching sequence table saved as .Rda file. It's the output of the removeBimeraDenovo() function </li>
        <li>reads_summary.tsv: Summary table to see how many reads were removed as chimeric</li>
        <li>summary.txt: Text file to see how many ASVs were found and how many were removed as chimeric</li>
        <li>sequence_table_nochim.tsv: The sequence (ASV) table produced after the removeBimeraDenovo() function printed out in a .tsv file. The column names/names of each ASV sequence are being edited to asv0, asv1... to make it easier to investigate the table.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
