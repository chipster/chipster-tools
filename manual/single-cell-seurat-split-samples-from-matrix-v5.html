    <h2>Seurat -Separate samples </h2>

    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
        This tool can be used to separate a sample from a large .tsv file matrix containing multiple samples.
        This multi-sample matrix is sometimes the format the data is stored in repositories when publishing an article.
        In this case, the column names usually contain the sample name before the cell barcode,
        for example "cauda_1.AAATGGTCAACA". In this case, the sample name, "cauda_1" can thus be
        used to separate the cells belonging to this particular sample into a separate tsv matrix.
        In this example case, "cauda_1" is to
        be typed by the user in the parameter field, exactly the same way it is written in the column names.

    <h3>Parameters</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Sample name to separate into own matrix [My_sample_name]</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Details</h3>

    <p>
        As an output the tool gives a smaller tsv matrix with only those cells (=columns) with the user
        defined sample name in the column header. This new tsv table containing only the cells
        belonging to this particular sample can then be given to the Setup and QC tool as a input:
        "DGE table in tsv format".

    <h3>Output</h3>

        <li>sample_{My_sample_name}.tsv: The tsv expression matrix containing only the cells of the chosen sample. </li>
    </ul>
