<h2>Identify primers and check the correct orientation</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
Given a tar package of fastq files or forward and reverse FASTQ files independently, this tool check if the adapters given as parameters 
were found how many times in which orientation from one sample. This tool uses the Biostrings and ShortRead libraries. 

</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Are the reads paired or single end?  (paired, single) [single]</li>
    <li>The 5´ end adapter to be trimmed:</li>
    <li>The 3' end adapter to be trimmed:</li>

</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>
<p>
This tool can be used to check if the 3´ / 5' primers were found from the sequence. You can give either a tar package of FASTQ files
or the forward/reverse FASTQ file independently. If you give a tar package, you need to specify if the reads are paired or single end.
<br>
It's recommended to run this tool before and after the adapter removal to be sure that the adapters were remove in correct orientation.
<br>
Please note that it might be a good idea to remove the ambigious bases for example with the tool "Filter and trim sequences with DADA2"
because the presence pf 'N' bases makes the accurate mapping of short primer sequences difficult. 
If you have 'N' bases the output tsv table might look weird. 
<br>
<br>
Please give the adapter sequence nucleotides using the DNA strings. The allowed letters/nucleotide codes can be seen <a href="https://www.bioinformatics.org/sms/iupac.html">here</a>.
<br>
This tool will use only one sample to check for the given primers and report how many times it was found in the read. Assuming that 
all the files/samples were created using the same library preparation, it's sufficient to just process one sample. 
<br>
So, in other words, if you give a tar package containing many samples, only one sample will be used to check for the primers.  
<br>
<br>
If you have paired end reads, the samples in the tar package should be named so that the forward and reverse files from one sample 
should have the same name but a different tag. 
<br>
<br>
This tool will also create a orientation-summary.txt file which has all the orientations of the 3' and 5' adapters. So, you can see 
and then copy the right orientation from there to Cutadapt tool to remove those. For more information on that check the tool Cutadapt.

<h3>Output</h3>
</p>
The analysis output consists of the following:
<ul>
    <li>primer-summary.tsv: A tsv table showing how many times the given adapters were found from one sample and in which orientation.</li>
    <li>orientations_summary.txt: A txt file to see all the different orientations of the adapters.</li>
</ul>
