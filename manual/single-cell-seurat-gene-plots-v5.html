	<h2>Seurat -Visualize genes </h2>

	<h3>Description</h3>

	<p>
		With this tool user can visualize selected genes with violin, UMAP and ridge plot. As input the user gives the
		Seurat R-object
		(.Robj) and the name of the gene of interest (for example MS4A1, LYZ, PF4...). The gene name(s) can also be
		given in the form of a text file to the input field.
		<br>Note: If you list multiple gene names, use comma (,) as separator.
	</p>

	<h3>Parameters</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Gene name</li>
		<li>Point size in cluster plot [1]</li>
		<li>Add labels on top of clusters in plot (yes, no) [no]</li>
		<li>Visualisation with tSNE, UMAP or PCA [UMAP]</li>
		<li>Plotting order of cells based on expression (yes, no) [no]</li>
		<li>Give a list of average expression and percentage of cells expressing in each cluster (yes, no) [no]</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Details</h3>

	<p>
		<b>Violin plot</b> and <b>ridge plot</b> show the probability density at different expression levels of the gene
		for each cluster.
		The color coding of the clusters helps to see in which clusters the marker gene is expressed.
		Good marker genes will show strongly in a single cluster.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>The UMAP plot</b> is useful for viewing the expression of the selected marker gene in the context of all the
		cells and helps validating the specificity of the marker or
		the quality of the clustering. It can be useful to plot the cells in the order based on expression, if the cells
		expressing given gene are getting buried.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can request to get two tables which show for each gene the average expression and the percentage of cells
		expressing it in each cluster.
