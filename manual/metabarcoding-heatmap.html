<h2>Heatmap of community profiles</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
Produces a heatmap to visualize taxon distribution and abundance across samples at a user-selected taxonomic level.
</p>


<h3>Parameters</h3>
<ul>
<li>Level of biological organization to display on the heatmap (OTU/ASV, Genus, Family, Order, Class, Phylum; the default is OTU/ASV)</li>
<li>Number of most abundant taxa to include (accepts integer values between 1 and 300; the default is 50)</li>
<li>Select a colour scheme (Light on dark, Dark on light, Contrast emphasized; the default is Light on dark)</li>
<li>Order samples by a phenodata variable (if selected, overrides the default similarity-based sample order)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Details</h3>
<p>
This tool requires the following input files:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/phyloseq.html">phyloseq</a> object in Rda format. 
</ul>
The heatmap visualizes the abundances of up to 300 most abundant taxa at the selected level of biological organization. Taxa are displayed 
on the y axis of the heatmap plot. If the heatmap is too crowded vertically, reduce the number of taxa with the parameter 
'Number of most abundant taxa to include'. Lightness and darkness of colours reflects the abundance of a taxon in a sample. 
The abundance values are displayed as defined in the Phyloseq object. To facilitate comparisons among samples, you can first transform OTU counts
to relative abundances with the tool 'Transform OTU counts' or rarery the counts with the tool 'Rarefy OTU data to even depth'.
<br>
<br>
Samples are displayed on the x axis of the heatmap plot, and they are ordered according to community profile similarity based 
on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity and NMDS ordination. This means that samples with similar community composition
are placed close to each other. Alternatively, samples can be ordered by a chosen phenodata variable in alphabetical order.
<br>
<br>
Three colour schemes are available: Light on dark (shades of blue on a black-dark blue background), Dark on light 
(shades of blue on a white background) and Contrast emphasized (shades of
blue-gray and yellow on a white background to improve contrast). For examples, please see 
<a href="https://joey711.github.io/phyloseq/plot_heatmap-examples.html">the Phyloseq heatmap examples</a>.
</p>

The tool employs the following R functions and packages:
<ul>
<li>tax_glom(), prune_taxa() and plot_heatmap() (<a href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/phyloseq.html">phyloseq</a>)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
The tool produces the following output files:</p>
<ul>
<li>Heatmap plot (ps_heatmap.pdf)</li>
</ul>
