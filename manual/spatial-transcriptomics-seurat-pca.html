	<h2>Seurat -PCA, clustering, and visualisation </h2>

	<h3>Description</h3>

	<p>
		This tool performs principal component analysis (PCA) on the highly variable genes, which were previously selected using
		the tool <b>Seurat v4 -Filter spots, normalize with SCTransform and detect high-variance genes</b>.
	</p>

	<h3>Parameters</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Number of principal components (PCs) to compute [30]</li>
		<li>Print loadings in a file [no]</li>
		<li>Number of genes to list in the loadings file [5]</li>
	</ul>


	<h3>Details</h3>

	<p>
		Provide a Seurat R-object (Robj) as input.
	</p>

	<p>
		If you have few spots in your data, you may get an error message. Try lowering the number of
		PCs to compute.
	</p>

	<p>
		This tool produces the following cluster plots:
		<ul>
			<li>Dimplot, shows the results of the dimensional reduction on a 2D scatterplot where each point is a spot positioned based on the spot embeddings determined by the reduction technique.
			</li>
			<li>SpatialDimPlot, shows the resulting clusters overlaid on the tissue image.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<p>
		You can also use the tool to output a *.txt file. This file will list the top genes (default = 5) associated with high or low loadings for the first 5 PCs in the <b>PCAloadings.txt</b> file.
	</p>

	</p>

	<h3>Output</h3>

	<ul>

		<li>seurat_obj_pca_clust.Robj: The Seurat R-object to pass to the next Seurat tool, or to import into R, but not viewable in
			Chipster. </li>
		<li>UMAP_plot.pdf: A plot presenting the PCs. Last plots are meant to aid in the selection of
			the PCs for the downstream analysis. </li>
		<li>PCAloadings.txt: If selected, the loadings (=genes responsible) of PCs</li>
	</ul>
