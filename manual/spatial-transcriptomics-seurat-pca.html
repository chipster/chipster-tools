	<h2>Seurat -PCA, clustering, and visualisation </h2>

	<h3>Description</h3>

	<p>
		This tool performs principal component analysis (PCA) on the highly variable genes, selected using
		the tool <b>Seurat v4 -Filter spots, normalize with SCTransform and detect high-variance genes</b>.
	</p>

	<h3>Parameters</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Number of PCs to compute [30]</li>
		<li>Print loadings in a file [no]</li>
		<li>Number of genes to list in the loadings file [5]</li>
	</ul>


	<h3>Details</h3>

	<p>
		As input, give a Seurat R-object (Robj).
	</p>

	<p>
		If you have low number of spots in your data, you might get an error message. Try lowering the number of
		principal components to compute.
	</p>

	<p>
		This tool produces the following cluster plots.
		<ul>
			<li>Dimplot showing the results of the dimensional reduction on a 2D scatter plot where each point is a spot and it's positioned based on the spot embeddings determined by the reduction technique.
			</li>
			<li>SpatialDimPlot showing the resulting clusters overlaid on the tissue image.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<p>
		You can also request the tool to output a txt file which lists the top N (default = 5)
		genes associated with high/low loadings for the first 5 PCs in the <b>PCAloadings.txt</b> file.
	</p>

	<h3>Output</h3>

	<ul>

		<li>seurat_obj_pca_clust.Robj: The Seurat R-object to pass to the next Seurat tool, or to import to R. Not viewable in
			Chipster. </li>
		<li>UMAP_plot.pdf: Graphics presenting the principal components. Last plots are meant to aid in the selection of
			the PCs for the downstream analysis. </li>
		<li>PCAloadings.txt: If requested, the loadings (=genes responsible) of principal components </li>
	</ul>
