<h2>Utilities / Calculate fold change</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculates a geometric average of gene expression for replicate chips and then calculates a difference or ratio between the averages. This tool is applicable only if the data has two groups.</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<ul>
<li>Column [group]</li>
</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>User needs to select a phenodata column that defines the grouping of the samples. Mark both groups in the phenodata file with numbers, and use smaller number for the control/baseline group. 
So for example control samples can be coded with "1" and treatment samples with "2" in the group column. 
Then Chipster knows to compare treatment to control (control is coded with a smaller number than the treatment). 
Since this makes a difference when interpreting the results such as fold change, it is worth paying attention to.</p>

<p>
First the samples in both groups are averaged using geometric mean - and then a fold change of these averages
is calculated. Fold change is reported in base 2 logarithmic scale.</p>


<h3>Output</h3>

<p>A table with the fold change values in fold-change.tsv</p>
