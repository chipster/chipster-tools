    <h2>Seurat -Rename clusters</h2>

    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
        With this tool, you can rename the clusters.
    </p>

    <h3>Parameters</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Point size in tSNE and UMAP plots [1]</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Details</h3>

    <p>
        With this tool, you can rename the clusters:
        for example, instead of "0", "1", "2"... give clusters names according the recognised cell markers
        or cell types, such as "NK", "CD8+ T", "Platelet".
        For this purpose, you need to create (for example with in Excel, text editor...)
        a tab separated .tsv file, which has the old cluster names in first column, and the
        new names in the second column.
    </p>
    <p>
        Like this:

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Cluster ID</th>
            <th>Cluster name</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>0</td>
            <td>Naive CD4+ T</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>CD14+ Mono</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>Memory CD4+</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>B</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <br>
    </p>

    <p>
        Note, that you need to give the same old cluster names (0, 1, 2...) in same order
        as they are in the Seurat R-object. You need to give name to each cluster (you can't have
        empty cells in the input table).
    </p>
