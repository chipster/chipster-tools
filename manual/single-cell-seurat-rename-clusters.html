    <h2>Seurat -Rename clusters</h2>

    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
        This tool allows you to rename clusters.
    </p>

    <h3>Parameters</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Point size in t-SNE and UMAP plots [1]</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Details</h3>

    <p>
        You can use this tool to rename clusters.
        For example, instead of "0", "1", or "2", you can provide cluster names according to recognised cell markers
        or cell types, such as "NK", "CD8+ T", or "Platelet".
        To do so, you will need to create
        a tab separated file (.tsv) using a program like Excel or another text editor. The file should contain old cluster names in first column and the
        new names in the second column.
    </p>
    <p>
        The layout should look similar to this:

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Cluster ID</th>
            <th>Cluster name</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>0</td>
            <td>Naive CD4+ T</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>CD14+ Mono</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>Memory CD4+</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>B</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <br>
    </p>

    <p>
        Please note that you will need to provide the old cluster names (0, 1, 2...) in the same order
        as in the Seurat R-object. You will also need to provide the name of each cluster (you cannot have
        empty cells in the input table).
    </p>

    <p></p>
