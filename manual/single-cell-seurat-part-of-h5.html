    <h2>Seurat -Extract only gene expression data from a multiomics h5 object </h2>

    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
        For a given cluster, this tool gives you the differentially expressed genes between the sample groups
        listed by the user.
        Sample groups are determined in the Setup tool with the Sample group parameter.
    </p>

    <h3>Parameters</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Output file name</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Details</h3>

    <p>
        As input, give a multiomics h5 object, from which you want to extract the Gene Expression part only.
        The output will be a matrix as a .tsv table, that can then be passed on to the Setup tool,
        or the Separate samples tool.
    </p>
