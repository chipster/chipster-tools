	<h2>Seurat -Visualize genes with cell type specific responses in multiple samples</h2>

	<h3>Description</h3>

	<p>
		This tool gives you plots showing user defined markers/genes across the conditions.
		This tool can be used for Seurat objects containing two or more samples.
	</p>

	<h3>Parameters</h3>
	<ul>
        <li>Normalisation method used previously [LogNormalize]</li>
		<li>Markers to plot [CD3D, CREM, HSPH1, SELL, GIMAP5]</li>
		<li>Scale data in split dot plot [no]</li>
		<li>Visualisation with tSNE, UMAP or PCA in feature plot [UMAP] </li>
		<li>Plotting order of cells based on expression in feature plot [no]</li>
		<li>Determine color scale based on all features in feature plot [no]</li>
	</ul>


	<h3>Details</h3>

	<p>
		As input, give a combined Seurat object. <br>
	</p>

	<p>
		Select the markers you want to inspect by listing them in the parameter row. The markers can also be given in
		then form of a text file to the input field.
		Separate the names with comma (,). As an example, the parameter is set to markers "CD3D, CREM, HSPH1, SELL,
		GIMAP5".
	</p>

	<p>
		The "split dot plot" can be useful for viewing conserved cell type markers across conditions,
		showing both the expression level and the percentage of cells in a cluster expressing any given gene.
		The <b>size of the dot</b> encodes the percentage of cells within a class (=cluster),
		while the <b>color</b> encodes the AverageExpression level of 'expressing' cells (stronger color, more
		experssion). By default, the raw expression data is used but the user can choose to use scaled data by 
		setting the parameter value for "plotting order of cells based on expression in feature plot" to "yes".
	</p>

	<p>
		Another useful way to visualize changes in gene expression is with "feature plots" that are also visualized 
		by splitting them by conditions. By default, the color scale in the feature plots are determined for each 
		gene individually and may differ between genes. If you wish to compare gene expression between different genes, 
		it is useful to set the parameter "determine color scale based on all features in feature plot" to "yes" so
		that the color scale is the same for all of the visualized genes.
	</p>

	<p>
		In case of more than 2 samples, the plots are divided to multiple pages.
