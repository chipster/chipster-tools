<h2>Make a Phyloseq object</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
Given a sequence_table saved as a .Rda object and a taxonomy_table saved as a .Rda object this tool creates an new
 <a href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/phyloseq.html">Phyloseq</a> object and saves it as an .Rda file.
It will create also an Phenodata file, which can be used to save sample information and then merge it to the Phyloseq 
object with the tool "Merge phenodata to the phyloseq object".
</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>
<ul>
    <li>None</li>

</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>
<p>
This tool creates a new Phyloseq object. To make a new phyloseq object, 
it needs an otu_table (ASV table created with "make contigs and remove chimeras") and a taxonomy_table (created with 
"assign taxonomy") saved as a .Rda file. 
<br><br>
s part of the import process, initial taxonomic rankings are renamed for clarity 
(Domain_Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species).
The input data may include taxonomic assignments at six levels (Domain_Kingdom to Genus) 
or seven levels (Domain_Kingdom to Species), depending on if addSpecies command was used or not. 
Assignments under the label Domain_Kingdom may consist of either domain- or kingdom-level classifications, 
depending on the reference employed. 
<br><br>
This tool creates also a metadata file called Phenodata which user can use to specify sample information for the
data analyses process with the phyloseq object. To combine the sample information from the phenodata file,
you should run the tool "Merge phenodata to the phyloseq object"
<p>

<h3>Output</h3>
</p>
The analysis output consists of the following:
<ul>
    <li>ps_nophe.Rda: A Phyloseq object without phenodata. </li>
    <li>ps_imported.txt: Text summary of the phyloseq object.</li>
</ul>
