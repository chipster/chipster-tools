    <h2>Seurat -Integrate multiple samples </h2>

    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
        This tool integrates multiple samples, clusters cells and visualizes the clusters
        using UMAP, tSNE or PCA.

    </p>

    <h3>Parameters</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Normalisation method used previously [Global scaling normalization]</li>
        <li>Anchor identification method [CCA, RPCA]</li>
        <li>Number of CCs to use in the neighbor search [30]</li>
        <li>Number of PCs to use in the integration [30]</li>
        <li>Number of PCs to use for UMAP or TSNE [30]</li>
        <li>Resolution for granularity [0.8]</li>
        <li>Visualisation of clusters with tSNE, UMAP or PCA [UMAP]</li>
        <li>Point size in cluster plot [0.5]</li>
        <li>Give a list of average expression in each cluster [no]</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Details</h3>

    <p>
        As inputs, give the Seurat object generated with <b>Seurat Merge & normalise, detect variable genes and
            regress</b>. Make sure you indicate which normalisation method
        was used in that step (the first parameter). <br>
    </p>

    <h4>Normalization method: Global scaling normalization vs SCTransform</h4>
    <p>
        The first parameter asks about the normalisation step performed in the tool: <b>Merge & normalise, detect
            variable genes and regress</b>.

    </p>

    <h4>CCA vs R-PCA in anchor identification</h4>

    <p>
        The <b>"anchor identification method"</b> parameter determines which anchor identification method to use.
        By default, canonical correlation analysis CCA is used, but user can also decide to use the
        faster and more conservative reciprocal PCA approach.
        When determining anchors between any two datasets using RPCA, each dataset is projected into the
        others PCA space and the anchors are constrained by the same mutual neighborhood requirement.
    </p>
    <p>
        By identifying shared sources of variation between datasets, CCA is well-suited for identifying anchors
        when cell types are conserved, but there are very substantial differences in gene expression
        across experiments, i.e. when experimental
        conditions or disease states introduce very strong expression shifts,
        or when integrating datasets across modalities and species.
        However, CCA-based integration may also lead to overcorrection,
        especially when a large proportion of cells are non-overlapping across datasets.
    </p>
    <p>
        RPCA-based integration runs significantly faster, and also represents a more conservative
        approach where cells in different biological states are less likely to "align" after integration.
        RPCA is thus recommended during integrative analysis where:
    <ul>
        <li>A substantial fraction of cells in one dataset have no matching type in the other </li>
        <li>Datasets originate from the same platform (i.e. multiple lanes of 10x Genomics) </li>
        <li>There are a large number of datasets or cells to integrate </li>
    </ul>

    </p>

    <h4>Integration steps and parameters</h4>

    <p>
        This tool performs data integration of multiple samples (in .Robj).
        First, Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is performed to identify common sources of variation between
        the datasets.
        The tool then identifies anchors, gives scores (=weights) to these anchors
        and then uses these anchors to integrate the datasets.
    </p>

    <p>
        The third parameter tells which dimensions from the CCA/PCA to use for specifying the neighbor seach space.
        The neighbors are used to determine the anchors for the alignment.
    </p>

    <p>
        The fourth parameter is the number of PCs to use in the anchor weighting procedure.
        The anchors and their weights are used to compute the correction vectors,
        which are used for correction, thus allowing the datasets to be integrated.
