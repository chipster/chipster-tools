	<h2>Preprocessing / Filter by column term</h2>

	<h3>Description</h3>

	<p>Filters NGS data based on textual terms in the selected data column.</p>

	<h3>Parameters</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>Column to filter by (...) [empty]</li>
		<li>Term to match (...) [empty]</li>
		<li>Does the first column have a title (yes, no) [yes]</li>
		<li>Mode (include, exclude) [exclude]</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Details</h3>

	<p>Filters rows in a table based on textual terms in the selected data column.
		For example, you can:
	<ul>
		<li>filter for text matches such as "upstream" or "downstream" in the output file from the "Find nearest genes
			for regions" tool.</li>
		<li>filter only genes of interest or filter out genes from a list of differentially expressed genes</li>
		<li>filter based on some terms in annotation columns (like "kinase" in the "description" field)</li>
	</ul>
	Notice that rows where the match term is only a part of the whole term are also passing the filter. </p>

	<p>You can choose to either include the rows with the given query terms, or to exclude them from the table. </p>

	<h3>Input</h3>

	<p>You give as an input the table you want to filter, and the query terms (such as gene names or terms)
		<b>either</b> as parameters (separate the terms with comma (,), like: "EEF2, AES, DAPK3"),
		<b>or</b> as a simple file, where each term is in one line (no headers). Note, that if the
		query term input file option if used, the terms given as parameters are not taken into account.
		Please check also that you have assigned the files correctly.
	</p>

	<h3>Output</h3>

	<p>A tabular text file containing only the set of rows that pass the filtering criteria.</p>
