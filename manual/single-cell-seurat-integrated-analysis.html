	<h2>Seurat -Integrated analysis of multiple samples </h2>

	<h3>Description</h3>

	<p>
		This tool performs integrated analysis of multiple samples. It clusters the cells and visualizes the clusters
		using
		UMAP, t-SNE, or PCA. You can input the Seurat object generated using the "Seurat v3 -Combine multiple samples"
		tool.
	</p>

	<h3>Parameters</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Number of PCs to use [20]</li>
		<li>Resolution for granularity [0.5]</li>
		<li>Visualisation of clusters with t-SNE, UMAP, or PCA [UMAP]</li>
		<li>Point size in cluster plot [0.5]</li>
		<li>Provide a list of the average expression levels found in each cluster [no]</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Details</h3>

	<p>
		This tool clusters the cells by constructing a Shared Nearest Neighbor (SNN) plot. It first determines the K
		(20) nearest neighbors of each cell and then uses this KNN graph to construct the SNN graph by calculating the
		neighborhood overlap (Jaccard index)
		between each cell and its 20 nearest neighbors. It performs the clustering in the principal component (PC)
		space. You can select the number of PCs.
	</p>

	<p>
		The resolution parameter sets the 'granularity' of the clustering
		with increased values leading to a greater number of clusters.
		Setting this parameter between 0.6-1.2 typically returns interpretable results for single cell datasets of around 3K
		cells.
		Optimal resolution often increases for larger datasets. Use a value above (or below) 1.0 if you would like to obtain a
		larger (or smaller) number of communities.
	</p>

	<p>
		Clustering results are visualized with either a UMAP, t-SNE or PCA plot, where you can select the plot point size for the
		cells.
	</p>

	<p>
		The tool can also return a table with expression for an 'average' single cell in each cluster.
