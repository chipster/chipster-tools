<h2>Statistics / PCA</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculates principal components for a set of samples.</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<ul>
<li>Variability to explain (0...100) [80]</li>
<li>Should data be scaled (yes,no) [no]</li>
<li>Should data be centered (yes, no) [yes]</li>
</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Performs principal component analysis for samples. Principal components
are retained until the explained variability exceeds the specified value.
In order to inspect the results, please see the file variance.tsv
which contains the principal components for the samples. 
You need to check the row "Proportion of Variance". 
Here you can see how big percentage of the the variance is explained
by the first principal component (PC1), the second principal component (PC2), etc. 
The most important one is PC1. 
If the percentage is high, it means this PC explains a big proportion
of the difference between the samples (ideally your sample groups separate along this axis).
If PC2 is large too, there is another factor affecting the gene expression in your samples.
This might be intentional depending on your experimental set up, but it can also be a batch effect.
In the latter case you should take it into account as a second factor in the statistical analysis.  </p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>The following output files are produced:
<ul>
<li>pca.tsv containing the principal components for the samples (these are not expression values).</li>
<li>variance.tsv where the row "proportion of variance" indicates how much of the variance is explained by each component.</li>
<li>loadings.tsv containing the component loadings. The higher the absolute value, the more that gene contributes to the difference in the samples along that principal component. </li>
</ul>
