<h2>Merge phenodata to the Phyloseq object</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
Given a Phyloseq object saved as a .Rda file and a Phenodata table, this tool merges the sample information from the Phenodata table
to the Phyloseq object.
</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Phenodata variable with unique IDs for each community profile</li>

</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>
<p>
This tool merges the sample information from the phenodata table to the phyloseq object with the 
merge_phyloseq() command. 
<br>
After the DADA2/asv pipeline, the sample information needs to be merged to the phyloseq object before the next analyse 
tools in Chipster.
<br> After the Mothur/OTU pipeline, the phenodata.tsv is already merged to the Phyloseq object
but this tool can be used to update the sample information. 
 
<h3>Output</h3>
</p>
The analysis output consists of the following:
<ul>
    <li>ps.Rda: A Phyloseq object saved as a .Rda object. </li>
    <li>ps_sample_summary.txt: Text summary of the phyloseq object.</li>
</ul>
