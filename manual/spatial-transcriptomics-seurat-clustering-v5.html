	<h2>Seurat v5 -Normalization, PCA, clustering, and visualization </h2>

	<h3>Description</h3>

	<p>
        This tool performs clustering for a single sample after the <i>"Seurat v5 -Normalization and PCA" step</i> or for multiple samples that
		have been combined into one Seurat object using the tool <i>"Seurat v5 -Combine multiple samples, normalization and PCA"</i>. This tool
		clusters the spots with a graph-based clustering approach and visualizes the clustering results.
	</p>

	<h3>Parameters</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Dimensions of reduction to use [50]</li>
		<li>Resolution for granularity [0.8]</li>

	</ul>

	<h3>Details</h3>

	<p>	
		Spots are clustered using the low dimensional space computed in the previous step either with PCA or CCA integration. The user can also reduce
		the dimensionality of the space for clustering by selecting a lower number for the "Dimensions of reduction to use" parameter. For example, if 
		only PCA was computed in the previous step with 50 PCs, the user can select 50 or less PCs or 'metagenes' to determine the space in which 
		clustering is performed. The user can use the visualizations produced in the previous step to help in selecting the dimensionality of the space.
	</p>
	<p> 
		Graph-based clustering is performed by calculating k-nearest neighbors, constructing a shared nearest neighbor (SNN) graph and optimzing the 
		modularity function to determine the clusters. First, a k-neareast neighbors graph is constructed using the Euclidean distance in the PCA space. 
		Then, the edge weights between any two spots are refined based on the shared overlap in their local neighborhoods (Jaccards distance). Then, the
		graph is cut into clusters using the Louvain algorithm which optimizes the standard modularity function. The parameter "Resolution for granularity
		for clustering" sets the granularity, with increased values leading to more clusters. 
	</p>
	<p>
		In order to visualize the clusters, a new non-linear dimensionality reduction is performed on the clustered space using UMAP.
	</p>
	<p>
		Finally, the tool produces two cluster plots that are colored by the clusters:
		<ul>
			<li>UMAP: shows the clustering results on a 2D scatterplot where each point is a spot positioned
				based on the spot embeddings determined by UMAP.</li>
			<li>Spatial clustering plot: shows the resulting clusters overlaid on the tissue image.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
