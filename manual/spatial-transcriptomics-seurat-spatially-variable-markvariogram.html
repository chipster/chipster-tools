	<h2>Seurat v4 -Identify spatially variable genes using markvariogram</h2>

	<h3>Description</h3>

	<p>
		This tool is an alternative to the "Seurat v4 -Identify spatially variable genes based on clusters". It searches features that exhibit spatial patterning in the absence of pre-annotation. 
    </p>
	

	<h3>Details</h3>

	<p>
        This tool identifies features exhibiting spatial patterning by using the method markvariogram for the selection. 
		Markvariogram models spatial transcriptomics data as a mark point process and computes a 'variogram', which identifies genes whose expression level is dependent on their spatial location. 
		More specifically, this process calculates gamma(r) values measuring the dependence between two spots a certain “r” distance apart. We only compute these values for variable genes (where variation is calculated independently of spatial location).
		As a result, a visualisation of the expression of the top 6 features is then drawn with the SpatialFeaturePlot.

    </p>

	<p>
		As input, you can give the Seurat object from the Seurat v4- PCA, clustering and visualisation. <br>
