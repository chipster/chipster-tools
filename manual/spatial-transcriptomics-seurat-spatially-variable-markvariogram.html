	<h2>Seurat v4 -Identify spatially variable genes using markvariogram</h2>

	<h3>Description</h3>

	<p>
		This tool searches for genes that exhibit spatial patterning. It does not use any pre-annotation (cluster) information. If you would like to identify cluster information, you may use this tool: "Seurat v4 -Identify spatially variable genes based on clusters". 
    </p>
	

	<h3>Details</h3>

	<p>
        This tool identifies and selects features exhibiting spatial patterning by using the method markvariogram. 
		Markvariogram models spatial transcriptomics data as a mark point process and computes a 'variogram', which identifies genes whose expression level is dependent on their spatial location. 
		Specifically, this process calculates gamma(r) values measuring the dependence between two spots that are a certain “r” distance apart. These values are only computed for variable genes (where variation is calculated independently of spatial location).
		The expression levels of the top 6 features are displayed in the SpatialFeaturePlot.

	<p>
		As input, you can provide the Seurat object generated using the tool: Seurat v4- PCA, clustering and visualisation. <br>
