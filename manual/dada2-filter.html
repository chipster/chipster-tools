<h2>Filter sequences with DADA2</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
Given a tar package of FASTQ files, this tool filters the input sequences which don't fullfill the user defined criteria.
This tool can be used either for single or paired end reads, but the type of the data needs to be specified. If the reads are single end, 
use the p forward read parameters.
<br>The filtered FASTQ files are put in one tar package
</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Is the data paired end or single end reads (paired, single) [paired]</li>
    <li>Truncate forward reads after this amount of bases ( 0- ) [0] </li>
    <li>Truncate reverse reads after this amount of bases (0 - ) [0]</li>
    <li>Discard input sequences with more than specified number of Ns (0 - ) [0]</li>
    <li>Discard forward sequences with more than the specified number of expected errors (0 - ) [empty]</li>
    <li>Discard forward sequences with more than the specified number of expected errors (0 - ) [empty]</li>
    <li>Truncuate reads at the first instance of a quality score less than or equal to the specified number (0 - ) [2]</li>
</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>
<p>
This tool takes a Tar package of FASTQ files (you can create one using the tool Utilities / Make a Tar package) and filters
them based on user specified parameters. The FASTQ files in the tar package can be compressed.
<br>
The data can be either paired end or single end reads, but you need to specify the right type with the first parameter.
<br>
If the reads are single end, then the parameters "Truncate reverse reads after this amount of bases" and 
"Discard reverse sequences with more than the specified number of expected errors" are not used. 
<br>
If the reads are paired end, then for one sample one reverse and one forward FASTQ file should be provided in which case
filtering is performed on the forward and reverse reads independently, and both reads must pass for the read pair no to be filtered.
<br>
<br>
Truncate reads after specified amount of bases is set to 0 by default which means that no truncation will happen.
<br>
Setting the parameter "Truncuate reads at the first instance of a quality score less than or equal" to 0, will turn off this behaviour.
<br>
For example, if parameter TRUNCQ=2 is set, it means that it will truncate the read at the first nucleotide with a quality score of 2 (if there is one). 
The read is only then discarded if it is now shorter than truncLen.
<br>
Max Ns should be kept 0 if you want to continue with the ASV/DADA2 pipeline, because the dada() function doesn't allow any Ns.
<br>
By default the maximum expected error parameter is not used which will mean that the parameter is set to 'Inf'. After truncation, reads with more 
than the specified number of expected errors will be discarded. 
<br>Expected errors are calculated from the nominal definition of the quality score: sum(10^(-Q/10)).
<br>
DADA2 tutorial suggest that the maximum expected errors threshold should be set to 2. 
<br> If your reads are high quality and you want to speed up downstream computation, you can try to tighten this parameter.
<br>
<br>
Note that thhis tool discards reads that match against PhiX genome.
<br>
<br>
Running the tool "Read quality with MultiQC for many FASTQ files" can help to determine the values for the parameters.
<br> If quality drops sharply at the end of your reads, reduce truncLen. 
<br>
If too few reads are passing the filter, try to change the parameter values for example by increasing
the maximun expected error and/or reducing truncQ. 
<br>
Remember when choosing the truncLen parameter you must maintain the overlap region for paired reads after truncation to merge them to contigs later.
<br>
<br>
If the data is paired end:
<br>
The FASTQ files/pair from one sample is recognized by the name of the files. Therefore those should be named so that the files from 
one sample/pair should have the same name but a different tag and the forward files should be before the reverse files 
after the sort() function.
<br>
The filtered FASTQ files will be named by splitting the filename with '_' and adding a 'F' or 'R' tag to the name.
<br>
You can check how the FASTQ files were assigned to samples from the result file samples.fastqs.txt. If the assignment
to samples is not correct, you can make a samples.fastqs.txt file yourself and give it as input. 
<br>
This file has 3 columns: sample name, name of the forward FASTQ file (R1), and name of the reverse FASTQ file name (R2) 
which have been separated with tabulator ('\t'), So the file and the names should be named like this:
<br>
<pre> 
sample1  sample1_xx_R1.fastq  sample1_xx_R2.fastq  
</pre>      
<br>
If the data is single end reads, then the filtered FASTQ files will be named by splitting the filename with '_'
<br>
<br>
This tool is based on the filterAndTrim() tool from the DADA2 package.

    <li>summary.txt: Summary statistics on how many reads where filtered from each sample.</li>
    <li>samples.fastqs.txt: Shows how the FASTQ files were assigned to samples</li>
</ul>
