<h2>Filter and trim sequences with DADA2</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
Given a tar package of FASTQ files, this tool filters the input sequences which don't fullfill the user defined criteria.
This tool can be used either for single or paired end reads, but the type of the data needs to be specified.
<br>The filtered FASTQ files are put in one tar package.
</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Is the data paired end or single end reads (paired, single) [paired]</li>
    <li>Truncate forward reads after this amount of bases (0 - ) [0] </li>
    <li>Truncate reverse reads after this amount of bases (0 - ) [0]</li>
    <li>Discard input sequences with more than specified number of Ns (0 - ) [0]</li>
    <li>Discard forward sequences with more than the specified number of expected errors (0 - ) [empty]</li>
    <li>Discard forward sequences with more than the specified number of expected errors (0 - ) [empty]</li>
    <li>Truncate reads after this base quality (0 - ) [2]</li>
    <li>The number of nucleotides to remove from the start of each read (0 - ) [0]</li>
    <li>The minimum read length. Removes reads shorter than this (0 - ) [0]</li>
</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>
<p>
This tool takes a Tar package of FASTQ files (you can create one using the tool <a href="https://chipster.rahtiapp.fi/manual/make_tar.html">Utilities / Make a Tar package</a>) and filters/trims
them based on the user specified parameters. The FASTQ files in the tar package can be compressed.
<br>
<br>
The data can be either paired or single end reads, but you need to specify the right type in the parameter tab.
If the reads are single end, use the parameters for forward reads! Then the reverse parameters "Truncate reverse reads after this amount of bases" and 
"Discard reverse sequences with more than the specified number of expected errors" are not used. 
<br>
If the reads are paired end, then for one sample one reverse and one forward FASTQ file should be provided in which case
filtering is performed on the forward and reverse reads independently, and both reads must pass for the read pair not to be filtered.
<br>
<br>Note that this tool discards reads that match against PhiX genome.
<br>
<br>
"Truncate reads at the first instance of a quality score less than or equal" is set by default to 2, which means that the reads
will be truncated at the first nucleotide with a quality score of 2 or less. This behaviour can be turned off by setting it to 0.
<br>
<br>
"Maximum number of ambiguous bases" should be kept 0 if you want to continue with the ASV/DADA2 pipeline, because the dada() function doesn't allow any Ns.
<br>
<br>
By default the maximum expected error parameter is set to 'Infinity'. After truncation, reads with more 
than the specified number of expected errors will be discarded. Expected errors are calculated from the nominal definition of the quality score: sum(10^(-Q/10)). The
<a href="https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/tutorial.html">DADA2 tutorial</a> suggest that the threshold for expected error filtering should be 2. 
However, if your reads are high quality and you want to speed up downstream computation, you can try to tighten this parameter.
<br>
<br>
Running the tool <a href="https://chipster.rahtiapp.fi/manual/fastqc_multiqc.html">Read quality with MultiQC for many FASTQ files</a> can help to determine the values of the parameters. 
    If the base quality drops sharply at the end of your reads, reduce truncLen (parameter "Truncate forward reads after this amount of bases"). 
<br>
If too few reads pass the filter, try to change the parameter values for example by increasing
the maximun expected error and/or reducing truncQ (parameter "Truncate reads after this base quality"). 
<br>
Remember when choosing the "Truncate reads after this many bases" parameter you must maintain the overlap region for paired end reads after truncation to merge them to contigs later.
Note that it will also discard sequences which are shorter than the given legnth.
<br>
<br>
The minimum lenght parameter can be used when the read lengths are varying and truncating to a given length is not suggested. For example, this is the case with ITS data.
<br>
<br>
The trim left parameter can be used to trim for example known adapter sequences from the start of the read.
<br>
<br>
If the data is paired end:
<br>
The FASTQ files/pair from one sample is recognized by the name of the files. Therefore, the files should be named so that 
the forward and reverse files from one sample/pair should have the same name but a different tag. 
Like _R1 for the forward file and _R2 for the reverse file.
<br>
The filtered FASTQ files will be named by splitting the filename with '_' and adding a 'F' or 'R' tag to the name.
Therefore different samples shouldn't have the same basename. 
<br>
You can check how the FASTQ files were assigned to samples from the result file samples.fastqs.txt. If the assignment
to samples is not correct, you can make a samples.fastqs.txt file yourself and give it as input. 
This file has 3 columns: sample name, name of the forward FASTQ file (R1), and name of the reverse FASTQ file name (R2) 
which have been separated with tabulator ('\t'), So the file and the names should be named like this:
<br>
<pre> 
sample1  sample1_xx_R1.fastq  sample1_xx_R2.fastq  
</pre>      
<br>
If the data is single end reads, you can use that input file to rename/specify the sample names. Otherwise,
the filtered FASTQ files will be named by splitting the filename with '_'. If the reads are single end, the samples.fastqs.txt
will have only 2 columns: sample name + '\t' + filename
<br>
<br>
This tool is based on the filterAndTrim() tool from the DADA2 package.

<h3>Output</h3>
</p>
The analysis output consists of the following files:
<ul>
    <li>filtered.tar: A Tar package containing all the filtered FASTQ files. </li>
    <li>summary.txt: Summary statistics on how many reads where filtered from each sample.</li>
    <li>samples.fastqs.txt: Shows how the FASTQ files were assigned to samples</li>
</ul>
</p>
