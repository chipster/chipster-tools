<h2>BAM tag histogram</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This Drop-seq tool extracts reads per cell barcode (=the number of reads assigned to an XC tag in a BAM file).
Based on this data, a cumulative distribution plot is generated. This plot can be used to estimate how many cells you would like
to extract from your BAM file in the DGE matrix. (The inflection point or "knee" of the distribution shows this.)
<br> 
The estimate of the inflection point is also provided in the inflectionPoint.txt file.
The estimation is done using the "inflection" package in R.
<br>
The number of STAMPs are the number of cell barcodes to the left of the inflection point (the "knee").
To the right of the inflection point are empty beads that have only been exposed to ambient RNA.
