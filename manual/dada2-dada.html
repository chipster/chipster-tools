<h2>Sample inference</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
Given a tar package of FASTQ files, this tool runs the learnErrors() and dada() functions from the DADA2 library.
This tool tries to remove all the sequencing errors to reveal the members of the sequenced community.
Note that the dada() function doesn't allow any Ns bases in the FASTQ files.
This tool can be used either for single or paired end reads.
</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Is the data paired end or single end reads? (paired, single) [paired]</li>
    <li>Do you want to visualize the error rates to an output pdf file? (no,yes) [yes]</li>
    <li>Type of pooling? (independent,pseudo) [independent]</li>
</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>
<p>
This tool takes a tar package of FASTQ files. The FASTQ files in the tar package can be compressed.
<br>
If the reads are paired end, you need to be carefull that the FASTQ files/pairs are assigned correctly to samples.
<br> Note that the dada() function doesn't allow any Ns bases in the FASTQ files. Therefore it's recommend to remove the Ns
and filter the reads with the tool "Filter sequences with DADA2" before and use the output tar package as the input for this tool. 
<br> That way also the names of the FASTQ file/sample pairs are handled correctly.
<br>
Otherwise the samples will be recognized based on the names of the files by splitting the filename with the underscore mark '_' 
and the reverse and forward files should have the same sample names but different tags like ('R1' and 'R2').
<br>
For more information, please check the manual of the tool "Filter sequences with DADA2".
<br>
<br>
First, the learnErrors() function is run for the both forward and reverse files independently. 
If the reads are single end, then the learnErrors() is run only for forward reads. Error rates are learned by alternating
between sample inferences and error rate estimation until convergence.<br>
Error rate estimation is performed with the error estimation function lossErrfun() which use a loess fit to estimate error rates from
transition counts.
<br>
<br> If the parameter "visualize error rates" is selected to "yes", then the error rates are visualized with plotErrors() function.<br>
Then all the observed frequencies of each transition (eg. A->C, A->G..) in a log(10) scale as a function of the associated quality score 
are being plotted. 
<br> The observed error rates for each consensus quality score are plotted as points, the estimated output error rates
as a black solid line and the expected error rates if quality scores matched exactly their nominal definition  Q = -10 log10(p_err),
as a red line. <br>
For more information check the DADA2 manual and learnErrors() and lossErrfun() functions.
<br> 
Note that the learnErrors() function can take quite long. 
<br>
The output of the learnErrors() function is a 16xN matrix and it's used as the err parameter for the dada() function. 
<br>
<br>
Dada() function is the core sample inference/ denoising algorithm in the DADA2 pipeline. It uses the error rate matrix 
produced by the learnErrors() function and the filtered FASTQ files provided as the input for this tool.
<br> It produces lists of dada-class objects: one from forward files 
and one from reverse files. 
<br> If the reads are single end, only one list of dada-class objects is produced.
<br> Dada-class objects are multi-item lists with many values. 
Those are saved as .Rda files for the next tools. 
<br>
<br>
 In other words, dada() function is used to provide the most accurate possible reconstruction of amplicon sequence
 variants (ASV) truly present in the samples from the noisy amplicon reads.
<br>
<br>
Dada() implements a statistical test for the notion that a specific sequence was seen too many times to have been caused by 
amplicon errors.
<br> Overly-abundant sequences are used as seeds of new partitions of sequencing reads and the final set
of partitions is taken to represent the denoised composition of the sample. 
<br> High accuracy for DADA2 pipeline requires both high sensitivity and spesificity. For that it uses OMEGA_A parameter 1e-40 
by default.
<br> That sets the level of the statistical evidence (p-value) required for inferences of a new ASV.  
<br> The accuracy of the estimated error rates affects the quality of the sample inference. 
<br> For more information on the statistical parameters check setDadaopt from the <a href=https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/manuals/dada2/man/dada2.pdf> DADA2 manual </a> 
<br> or <a href="https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/pseudo.html#pseudo-pooling">pseudo-pooling</a>
<br>
<br>
If the parameter pooling is set to pseudo, dada() uses a 2 step process in which the independent processing is run twice. 
<br> First on the raw data alone, and then on the raw data again, but this time informed by priors generated from the first run.
<br> All ASVs detected in at least two samples in the first sample processing step are input as priors to the second step.
<br> Pseudo-pooling takes longer (approximately 2 times longer than independent processing) but with that more ASVs are observed per 
sample and more chimeras are being identified. 
<br>
Pseudo-pooling approximates pooling in linear time. 
<br>
Pseudo-pooling can provide a more accurate description of ASVs especially at very low frequencies for example in longitudinal 
experiments. However, independent sample inference is still very accurate and less prone to report certain false-positives.

<br>
<br>
This tool is based on the learnErrors() and dada() functions from the DADA2 R-package.
