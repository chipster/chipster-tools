        <li>Filter out cells which have less than this many genes expressed [200]</li>
        <li>Filter out cells which have more than this many genes expressed [2500]</li>
        <li>Filter out cells which have higher mitochondrial transcript percentage [5]</li>
    </ul>
    </p>


    <h3>Details</h3>

    <p>
