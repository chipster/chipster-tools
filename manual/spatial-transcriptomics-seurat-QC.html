	<h2>Seurat v4-Setup and QC </h2>

	<h3>Description</h3>

	<p>
		This tool creates a Seurat object from 10x Visium data of the following input files.
	     After setting up the R-object (.Robj), some quality control plots are drawn.
	</p>


	<h3>Details</h3>

	<p>
		You can give 10x Visium data as input. The input file should be a tar packed folder of 10X Genomics output files <i>feature/barcode matrix HDF5 (filtred), spatial imaging data</i>. 
			<br>These three files are generated by the Space Ranger -pipeline, and can be found under a folder
			corresponding to the filtered_feature_bc_matrix example
			<a
				href="https://support.10xgenomics.com/spatial-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/output/matrices">here</a>.
			Make sure that you use the filtered data which contains only the cell barcodes present in your data,
			as opposed to the unfiltered data containing millions of barcodes (this will very likely jam the tools).
			<br>You need to tar the folder into a package. There are graphical programs for this, such as 7-zip, or
			you can use
			command prompt (Windows) / Terminal (Mac) with command: tar -czvf name-for-your-package.tar.gz
			/path/to/folder-you-want-to-tar. You can also use the Chipster tool <i>Utilities - Make a tar
				package</i>.
		</li>
	</ol>

	This tool produces the following quality control plots
	(note that it might be easier to view the large QCplots.pdf file with an external viewer):
	<ul>
		<li>Violin plots showing the number of UMIs (nCount_Spatial) in the cells.These plots can be used to estimate the upper limits for
			number of genes or molecules per cell and the percentage of mitochondrial transcripts, which you can use in the <a
				href="link-to-sctransform">filtering tool</a>.
		</li>
		<li>Spatial Feature plot showing number of UMIs as spots over the spatial image .</li>
	</ul>
